## What are Use Scenarios and Personas? {#what-are-use-scenarios-and-personas}


### Use Scenarios {#use-scenarios}

A use [Scenario]({{<relref "20220130132918-scenario.md#" >}}) is a story or narrative—a thought experiment that is used to help
you explore the set of tasks and interactions required for your design. A good
use scenario does a number of things:

-   Describes the user's goals and motivations.
-   Describes a specific task or tasks that need to be accomplished.
-   Describes some of the interaction, with enough detail to make it compelling,
    but not so much detail as to be overwhelming.
-   Provides a shared understanding for everyone on your team about what a user
    might want to do and how they might do it.
-   Helps you construct the sequence of events that are necessary to address in
    your user interface.
-   Can be sketchy, as long as it provokes ideas and discussion.


### Personas {#personas}

A [Persona]({{<relref "20210822033315-persona.md#" >}}) (also known as an archetypal user) is an invented person that you use
to represent a type of user in your use scenario.
