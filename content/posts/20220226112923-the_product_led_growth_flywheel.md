## The Product-Led Growth Flywheel {#the-product-led-growth-flywheel}

SaaS businesses have been using Dave McClure’s [Pirate Metrics]({{<relref "20211029121906-pirate_metrics.md#" >}}) framework for over
a decade now.
But the pirate metrics were developed in 2007.


### What is the Product-Led Growth Flywheel? {#what-is-the-product-led-growth-flywheel}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-02-27_22-27-43_615aedfb04cc8ce4c733173c_found-flywheel-steps.gif" >}}

[Product-Led Growth Flywheel]({{<relref "20220227223049-product_led_growth_flywheel.md#" >}})
In this framework, the experience is designed to generate higher user
satisfaction and increased advocacy, which in turn drives compounding growth of
new user acquisition.

It depicts 4 sequential user segments that correlate with stages in the user
journey from awareness to evangelism—evaluator, beginner, regular, and
champion—and the key actions that users need to take to graduate to the next
stage—[activate](#org41962e8), [adopt](#org1e4b093), [adore](#org9579a4c), and [advocate](#orgf96799d).


### Methodology {#methodology}

We interviewed over 50 companies covering a range of sizes and business
models—from direct-to-consumer companies with over 500 employees to B2B SaaS
businesses with fewer than 10.

#### [Evaluators](#org080131f) {#}

<a id="org080131f">Evaluators</a> 评估者
[Evaluators](#org080131f) are typically:

-   In a trial or demo phase—they’ve just started playing around with your product
-   Not installed or using real data
-   Not using your product in their current workflows
-   Still searching for a solution to a problem they are trying to solve

<!--list-separator-->

-  What they want from your product

    [Evaluators](#org080131f) want to know that you understand their problem and can offer them a
    clear path to solving it.

<!--list-separator-->

-  How to deliver value

    In short, guide [evaluators](#org080131f) to their [Aha Moment]({{<relref "20211104132111-aha_moment.md#" >}}).

    The goal is to guide [evaluators](#org080131f) to value and get them to [activate](#org41962e8).


#### [Activate](#org41962e8) {#}

<a id="org41962e8">Activate</a>
Activation looks different for every company. But at its core, activation is a
feeling that the user experiences.

Once you’ve identified the activation events within your product, your goal
should be to help your users get there quickly and minimize their [Time-to-Value]({{<relref "20220227223812-time_to_value.md#" >}}).

<!--list-separator-->

-  Who is responsible for activation?

    growth, product, or customer success team member
    Once a user has activated through these combined efforts, they progress in their
    user journey and graduate to the beginner stage of the flywheel.


#### [Beginners](#org7797f97) {#}

<a id="org7797f97">Beginners</a>
[Beginners](#org7797f97) understand how your product can meet their needs and deliver value—and
they’re excited about it!

<!--list-separator-->

-  [Beginners](#org7797f97) are typically

    -   Incorporating your product into their workflows
    -   Starting to use real data and receiving tangible value
    -   Not using advanced functionality or implementing sophisticated use cases
    -   Feeling confident that your product is the best solution to solve their problem

<!--list-separator-->

-  What they want from your product

    [Beginners](#org7797f97) are starting to demonstrate signs of commitment. They’re eager to
    learn more to discover additional benefits your product may provide beyond the
    use case that initially brought them to you.

<!--list-separator-->

-  How to deliver value

    your focus should be on helping users build on the foundational knowledge they
    achieved as [evaluators](#org080131f), discover additional features that may address secondary
    problems or make their workflow more efficient, and generally connect the dots
    between your product and their day-to-day.

    The goal is to get users to fully [adopt](#org1e4b093) your product through habitual, more
    advanced usage.


#### [Adopt](#org1e4b093) {#}

<a id="org1e4b093">Adopt</a>
Adoption is about forming habits and getting users to associate your product
with a specific task or solution. Users who have adopted your product don’t put
a lot of thought into deciding to use your product regularly, they just use it.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Who is responsible for product adoption?

    Product, support, and customer success

    When users [adopt](#org1e4b093) successfully, they move through the flywheel and become regular
    users of your product.


#### [Regulars](#orgfec6fe9) {#}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Regular users are typically:

    <a id="orgfec6fe9">Regulars</a>

    -   Logging in on a regular basis
    -   Using your product to complete core parts of their job
    -   Defaulting to your product as a possible solution when new problems arise
    -   Exploring deeper layers of your product to see what else your product help them do

<!--list-separator-->

-  What they want from your product

    [Regulars](#orgfec6fe9) want to enjoy using your product—they use it frequently, after all—and
    they are easily frustrated by friction.

    These users are often searching for new ways to obtain value from your product,
    either through new use cases or through efficiencies that save them time on
    existing tasks.

    [Regulars](#orgfec6fe9) are also likely curious about how your product will grow with them to
    address their evolving needs.

<!--list-separator-->

-  How to deliver value

    Educational content is another great way to engage users at this stage of their
    journey.

    Don’t bombard [regulars](#orgfec6fe9) with too much communication, but do check up on them to
    make sure that they are having a delightful product experience.

    The goal here is more than just habitual usage or product adoption—it’s
    emotional. To move users through the flywheel, you need them to [adore](#org9579a4c) your
    product.


#### [Adore](#org9579a4c) {#}

<a id="org9579a4c">Adore</a>
Users who [adore](#org9579a4c) your product don’t just use it frequently—they enjoy using it,
look forward to accomplishing tasks, and have a real desire to expand into new
use cases.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Who is responsible for getting users to [adore](#org9579a4c) your product?

    Every team in your company should be concerned

    When a user truly adores your product, they graduate to the ultimate stage of
    the user journey and become a champion.


#### [Champions](#orge501412) {#}

<a id="orge501412">Champions</a>
[Champions](#orge501412) are typically:

-   Actively participating in the future of your product
-   Pushing the limits of your product with new use cases
-   NPS promoters
-   Wearing your brand’s t-shirt

<!--list-separator-->

-  What they want from your product

    [Champions](#orge501412) enjoy feeling like a partner or friend to your business. They want to
    actively participate in your future because they are invested in it.

<!--list-separator-->

-  How to deliver value

    Let them know the feeling is mutual. Offer them swag, advanced guidance,
    power-use features, and first dibs on beta versions.

    When thinking through the Product-Led Growth Flywheel, the goal at this point is
    clear—you want your [champions](#orge501412) to [advocate](#orgf96799d).


#### [Advocate](#orgf96799d) {#}

<a id="orgf96799d">Advocate</a>
Advocacy—inviting other users to your product, leaving reviews, actively
evangelizing—drives awareness and evaluator interest in your product, completing
the cycle and leading to compounding growth.
