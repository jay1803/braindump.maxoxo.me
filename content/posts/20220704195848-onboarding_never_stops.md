Fun fact: when [Microsoft]({{< relref "20220117204930-microsoft.md" >}}) asked their users what they wanted added to Office, they found 90% of the requested features were already there.

Ultimately, the best onboarding retains customers over time by continually showing them how to get the most out of your product.


## Onboard in context {#onboard-in-context}

Your goal should never be “get it launched”. Your goal is “get it used”.

For Smart Campaigns, we announced the new feature to customers when they arrived in the messaging area of Intercom, via an in-app announcement. That message contained a video with a high-level overview of the feature and instructions to get started.


## Use educational content to onboard {#use-educational-content-to-onboard}

Take Trello, for example. Users are given a welcome board with pre-made to-do cards, with each card explaining a different interaction. They use content and the interface to teach you how to use the product


## Anticipate the next questions {#anticipate-the-next-questions}

One of the best ways to do this is to center information around the intent of the customer.


## Gradually expose features over time {#gradually-expose-features-over-time}

Onboarding users to a new feature requires the same skill as onboarding them to a new product. You wouldn’t welcome new users to your product by asking them to do complex tasks only a pro user would be able to do.
