## Definition {#definition}

是指人（通常是指孩童或学生）在被赋予更高期望以后，他们会表现的更好的一种现象。
If a teacher believed a student was “gifted” or “smart,” the teacher would act
in ways that encouraged the student to live up to that assessment. If the
teacher believed a student was “difficult” or “challenged,” they wouldn’t
receive as much support and wouldn’t perform as well—a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
