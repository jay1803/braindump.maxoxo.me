### GIST {#gist}


### Goals {#goals}

> “If you tell people where to go, but not how to get there, you’ll be amazed at
> the results”
> — George S. Patton.

Goals embody this principle — they describe the company strategy in terms of
desired outcomes: where we want to be, by when, and how will we know that we got
there.


### Ideas {#ideas}

> “If you want to have good ideas you must have many ideas. Most of them will be
> wrong, and what you have to learn is which ones to throw away“
> — Linus Pauling


### Step-projects {#step-projects}

we break the bigger project behind the idea into small step-projects, each no
more than 10 weeks long, and execute them one at a time. For example: mockup →
prototype → MVP → dogfood → beta → Launch


### Tasks {#tasks}


### The planning cycle {#the-planning-cycle}
