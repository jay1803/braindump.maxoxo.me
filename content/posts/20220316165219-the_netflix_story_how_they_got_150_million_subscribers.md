## THE NETFLIX STORY: HOW THEY GOT 150 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS {#the-netflix-story-how-they-got-150-million-subscribers}


### Early careers {#early-careers}

Back in 1997, [Marc Randolph]({{<relref "20220316164115-marc_bernays_randolph.md#" >}}), 39, worked as marketing director at 37-year-old
Hastings’ company.

He became fascinated by using computer software to track customers’ buying
behaviour while devising new ways of selling sheet music.


### Birth of Netflix {#birth-of-netflix}

They came up with the idea for [Netflix]({{<relref "20220316163546-netflix.md#" >}}) when they shared a car to commute to work
from their homes in Santa Cruz to Pure Atria’s HQ in Sunnyvale.

Randolph said his three-year-old daughter hadn’t been able to sleep the night
before, so he had rented a used copy of Aladdin for her. Hastings recalled how
he had received a $40 late fee from Blockbuster after renting out Apollo 13.
They began to form an idea of making it easier for people to rent movies.


### Company launch {#company-launch}

On 14th April 1998, [Netflix]({{<relref "20220316163546-netflix.md#" >}}) was launched, thanks to various investors, including
$25,000 from Randolph’s mother.

[Amazon]({{<relref "20210822220641-amazon.md#" >}}) founder Jeff Bezos tried to acquire [Netflix]({{<relref "20220316163546-netflix.md#" >}}) to get into the DVD market,
but Randolph and Hastings resisted his bid, hoping they could salvage their
company.

They expanded the brand’s subscriber base by offering free trials, which made
the rental service popular, but they were also losing money.


### Revolutionary idea {#revolutionary-idea}

After introducing monthly subscriptions in late 1999, there were around 300,000
subscribers by 2000 and the business began steadily growing.

## Reviews {#reviews}

I don't think this article get the core, well [Netflix]({{<relref "20220316163546-netflix.md#" >}}) raise not only
because of the subscription business model, but also the personalization and AB
testing for basically everything. Sometime you just have an idea, it's not
working untile you test it.
