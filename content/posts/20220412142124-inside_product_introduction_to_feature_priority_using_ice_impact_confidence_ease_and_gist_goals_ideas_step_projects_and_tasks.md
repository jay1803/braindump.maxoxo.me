## Inside Product: Introduction to Feature Priority using ICE and GIST {#inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-and-gist}


### What is ICE? {#what-is-ice}


### Impact {#impact}

The best way to measure impact is to understand how does it move a user/
customer across the funnel [AAARRR]({{<relref "20211029121906-pirate_metrics.md#aaarrr" >}}).

### Confidence {#confidence}

is a measure of the conviction required that warrants the feature build out.

### Ease {#ease}

measured in time to determine how much work will be required for the feature to
be shipped.

What does this mean in terms of a product roadmap that has the shipping and
forecasting integrity required to see features through the next 3, 6 and 12
months? Introducing GIST (Goals, Ideas, Step Projects and Tasks).


### What is GIST? {#what-is-gist}

Goals are an aggregation of a product managerâ€™s [OKR]({{<relref "20211114142044-okr.md#" >}})s

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-04-12_14-41-27_1_Yf2y7C5lq7-aPpdfTwWOpw.png" >}}

Ideas involve activities or objectives that will lead to desired results. At a
macro-level they can be broken down by function and individual into an OKR tree.

Step Projects allow for the breakup of objective(s) into 10 week long or 5 week
sprint cycle projects. Step projects are useful in shipping projects to meet
quarterly targets, including visualization of parallel and sequential step
projects that allow for small and large product step changes.

Tasks are bite-sized versions of step projects. They are stories with story
points and velocities introduced across sprint cycles. They are adjusted daily
by the responsible product manager. Tasks are where [ICE]({{<relref "20211102135254-ice_framework.md#" >}}) scores are introduced.
