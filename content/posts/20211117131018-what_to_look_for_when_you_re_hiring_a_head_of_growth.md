## What to look for when you’re hiring a Head of Growth {#what-to-look-for-when-you-re-hiring-a-head-of-growth}

scaling growth into millions of users. The first few stages are very different:

The Cold Start Problem = Getting a critical mass of users to prove product/market fit
Tipping Point = Finding a playbook to find repeatable growth
Escape Velocity = Scaling up growth across many efforts and channels


### Context, goals, and assessment for The Cold Start Problem {#context-goals-and-assessment-for-the-cold-start-problem}

The Cold Start Problem

-   Goal: Getting a critical mass of users to prove product/market fit
-   Roadmap: A series of “Hustle”-driven efforts — often idiosyncratic,
    entrepreneurial, and surprising
-   Outcomes: A stable “atomic network” of users who retain, are engaged, and
    provide a launching pad for the next phase


### What’s needed to succeed at the Tipping Point {#what-s-needed-to-succeed-at-the-tipping-point}

Tipping Point

-   Goal: Finding a playbook to find repeatable growth
-   Roadmap: Testing a series of more scalable growth channels, showing that if
    one network can be built, then multiple networks might be launched as well
-   Outcomes: At least one scalable growth strategy. Typically organic “pull”
    from the market combined with a scalable channel with reasonable metrics
    (CAC/LTV, or viral factor, or otherwise) going into in-app acquisition
    funnels


### Next is Escape Velocity {#next-is-escape-velocity}

At this point, the product is ready for Escape Velocity if it’s consistently
growing >3-5x year-over-year growth rate with at least one (if not two)
channels that are obvious levers

Escape Velocity

-   Goal: Scaling up growth across many efforts and channels
-   Roadmap: Multiple growth strategies — primarily 2 or 3 — that work in
    concert to grow the product to millions or tens of millions of users
-   Outcomes: Multiple scalable channels, combined with optimizing the in-app
    acquisition and engagement loops


### The most common pitfall {#the-most-common-pitfall}

The problem is, a startup’s growth is so fundamental that the founders have
to take it on themselves.

The second biggest mistake is probably to hire the “executive” Head of Growth
too soon.

In the end, the “Head of Growth” title is probably too vague. Each of these
stages requires such different skills and are judged so differently that a
single title feels like it doesn’t capture the nuance
