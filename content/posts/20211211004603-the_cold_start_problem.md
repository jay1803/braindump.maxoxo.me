## Introduction {#introduction}


#### A Network of Networks {#a-network-of-networks}


#### Foundational Questions {#foundational-questions}


#### The Definitive Guide to Network Effects {#the-definitive-guide-to-network-effects}

The Cold Start Problem is the culmination of hundreds of interviews, three years
of research and synthesis, and nearly two decades of experience as an investor
and operator. It takes much of the knowledge and core concepts swirling inside
the technology industry and frames them in the context of the beginning, middle,
and end of a network’s life cycle. This is the core framework I’ll describe via
the major sections of this book, along with examples, and providing an
actionable road map for your own products.


## Part I: Network Effects {#part-i-network-effects}


### 1. What’s a Network Effect, Anyway? {#1-dot-what-s-a-network-effect-anyway}


#### The Billion Users Club {#the-billion-users-club}

the [Network Effect]({{<relref "20210313214856-network_effect.md#" >}}) can be defined by breaking the term into its constituent
parts—the “network” and the “effect.”

The “network” is defined by people who use the product to interact with each
other.
These networks are counterintuitive in that they connect people, but don’t own
the underlying assets.

The “effect” part of the network effect describes how value increases as more
people start using the product.

The questions to ask are simple: First, does the product have a network?
And second, does the ability to attract new users, or to become stickier, or to
monetize, become even stronger as its network grows larger?

While the terms are different, the core concepts and the math are the same: The
Allee effect → The Network Effect Allee Threshold → Tipping Point Carrying
capacity → Saturation


### 3. Cold Start Theory {#3-dot-cold-start-theory}


#### The Framework {#the-framework}

I call this framework [Cold Start Theory]({{<relref "20211211012938-cold_start_theory.md#" >}}), named for the first and most important
stage in building network effects.

There are five primary stages:

1.  The Cold Start Problem
2.  Tipping Point
3.  Escape Velocity
4.  Hitting the Ceiling
5.  The Moat


#### 1. The Cold Start Problem {#1-dot-the-cold-start-problem}

Solving the Cold Start Problem requires getting all the right users and content
on the same network at the same time—which is difficult to execute in a launch.

focuses on building an “<a id="org5f4fa79">atomic network</a>”—that is, the smallest possible network
that is stable and can grow on its own.


#### 2. Tipping Point {#2-dot-tipping-point}


#### 3. Escape Velocity {#3-dot-escape-velocity}

The Escape Velocity stage is all about working furiously to strengthen network
effects and to sustain growth.

I redefine it so that it’s not one singular effect, but rather, three distinct

the Acquisition Effect, which lets products tap into the network to drive
low-cost, highly efficient user acquisition via viral growth

the Engagement Effect, which increases interaction between users as networks fill in

the Economic Effect, which improves monetization levels and conversion rates as
the network grows.


#### 4. Hitting the Ceiling {#4-dot-hitting-the-ceiling}


#### 5. The Moat {#5-dot-the-moat}


#### Five Stages {#five-stages}

Cold Start Theory is meant to apply to a large set of companies in the
technology industry: video platforms, marketplaces, workplace collaboration
tools, bottom-up SaaS products, social networks and communications apps, and
more

Many of these ideas generalize beyond the world of mobile apps, as my friend
Naval Ravikant, a noted investor and entrepreneur, has observed: Humans are the
networked species. Networks allow us to cooperate when we would otherwise go it
alone. And networks allocate the fruits of our cooperation. Money is a network.
Religion is a network. A corporation is a network. Roads are a network.
Electricity is a network.
