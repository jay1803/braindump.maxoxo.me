## Your guide to product-led marketing <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#your-guide-to-product-led-marketing}

Look at [HubSpot]({{< relref "20220110110120-hubspot.md" >}}) , the CRM platform with a $22 billion market cap, for inspiration. HubSpot’s top three ways of attracting new users are word of mouth (33%), Google (26%) and HubSpot’s blog (13%), according to the company’s Q3 2021 Investor Presentation.

### 1 - Template gallery {#1-template-gallery}

-   Programmatic templates: For example, “How to do X+Y” pages.
-   Bespoke templates: You actually create your own templates along with content around them.

[Zapier]({{< relref "20220630223425-zapier.md" >}}) has mastered the art of the programmatic template play.
Other examples I love include:

-   [Coda’s Gallery](https://coda.io/gallery)
-   [Miro’s Templates Library](https://miro.com/templates/)
-   [Notion’s Template Gallery](https://www.notion.so/templates)
-   [Airtable’s Templates](https://www.airtable.com/templates)
-   [Cascade’s Strategy Template Library](https://www.cascade.app/templates/)


### 2 - Product-related hubs {#2-product-related-hubs}

[Hotjar]({{< relref "20220630223658-hotjar.md" >}}), the website analytics company, does this to great effect with product hubs around features like heatmaps and session recordings. In fact, the company has the #1 result on organic search for “heatmaps”, “heatmap tool”, and “heatmaps guide”.

Here’s how Hotjar does it:

-   They start by addressing the high-level intent of the visitor (“what is a heatmap?”)
-   They challenge the visitor’s question and raise the stakes (“here’s why you’re wrong and need to rethink it”)
-   They address the broad range of related questions that folks have (examples of heatmaps, how to analyze it, how to create it, who invented it, how to use it on a WordPress site)
