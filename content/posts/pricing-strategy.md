## Nine laws of price sensitivity and consumer psychology {#nine-laws-of-price-sensitivity-and-consumer-psychology}

In their book, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing, Thomas Nagle and Reed
Holden outline nine "laws" or factors that influence how a consumer perceives
a given price and how price-sensitive they are likely to be with respect to
different purchase decisions.

They are:

1.  Reference Price Effect – buyer's price sensitivity for a given product
    increases the higher the product's price relative to perceived
    alternatives. Perceived alternatives can vary by buyer segment, by
    occasion, and other factors.

2.  Difficult Comparison Effect – buyers are less sensitive to the price of a
    known or more reputable product when they have difficulty comparing it to
    potential alternatives.

3.  Switching Costs Effect – the higher the product-specific investment a buyer
    must make to switch suppliers, the less price sensitive that buyer is when
    choosing between alternatives.

4.  Price-Quality Effect – buyers are less sensitive to price the more that
    higher prices signal higher quality. Products for which this effect is
    particularly relevant include: image products, exclusive products, and
    products with minimal cues for quality.

5.  Expenditure Effect – buyers are more price-sensitive when the expense
    accounts for a large percentage of buyers' available income or budget.

6.  End-Benefit Effect – the effect refers to the relationship a given purchase
    has to a larger overall benefit, and is divided into two parts: Derived
    demand: The more sensitive buyers are to the price of the end benefit, the
    more sensitive they will be to the prices of those products that contribute
    to that benefit. Price proportion cost: The price proportion cost refers to
    the percent of the total cost of the end benefit accounted for by a given
    component that helps to produce the end benefit (e.g., think CPU and PCs).
    The smaller the given components share of the total cost of the end
    benefit, the less sensitive buyers will be to the components' price.

7.  Shared-cost Effect – the smaller the portion of the purchase price buyers
    must pay for themselves, the less price sensitive they will be.

8.  Fairness Effect – buyers are more sensitive to the price of a product when
    the price is outside the range they perceive as "fair" or "reasonable"
    given the purchase context.

9.  The Framing Effect – buyers are more price sensitive when they perceive the
    price as a loss rather than a forgone gain, and they have greater price
    sensitivity when the price is paid separately rather than as part of a
    bundle.
