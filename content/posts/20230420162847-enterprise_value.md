## Define {#define}

Enterprise value (EV) measures a company's total value, often used as a more comprehensive alternative to [market capitalization]({{< relref "20210214224317-market_capitalization.md" >}}). EV includes in its calculation the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt and any cash or cash equivalents on the company's [balance sheet]({{< relref "balance-sheet.md" >}}).


## Formula {#formula}

EV = [MC]({{< relref "20210214224317-market_capitalization.md" >}}) + [Total Debt]({{< relref "20230420163502-total_debt.md" >}}) âˆ’ [Cash]({{< relref "20230420164222-cash.md" >}}) and cash equivalents.
