## Micro + Macro Loops {#micro-plus-macro-loops}

On the micro side, these are the more day-to-day levers that you are pulling to acquire and retain users.

-   [Viral Loop]({{< relref "20211103203550-viral_loop.md" >}}): One person leads to another person signing up
-   [Content Loop]({{< relref "20221018141900-content_loop.md" >}}): Content brings in signups which enables more content
-   [Paid Loop]({{< relref "20221018141936-paid_loop.md" >}}): Ads bring in signups which enables more ads

These are less tactical and more strategic tailwinds enabled by your product and business model.

-   [Direct Network Effect]({{< relref "20221018142113-direct_network_effect.md" >}}): When value to a user increases as more people use the product
-   [Cross-Side Network Effect]({{< relref "20221018142155-cross_side_network_effect.md" >}}): When value to one type of user increases as more users of another type use the product
-   [Data Network Effect]({{< relref "20221018142223-data_network_effect.md" >}}): When the quality or cost of the product improves as more usage data is collected
-   [Economic of Scale]({{< relref "20210808123254-economic_of_scale.md" >}}): When volume grows, returns increase leading to more volume
-   [Brand]({{< relref "20210323135948-brand.md" >}}): When social capital is built through other compounding loops


## Defining Your Growth Model <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#defining-your-growth-model}

Start by using the menu of loops above to build out something like this for your product:

## Attacking Points of Leverage {#attacking-points-of-leverage}

Using the map above, start looking for points of leverage. Lean on the questions, "What can we reasonably increase?" and "What impact will an X% increase have on outcomes?" to guide your analysis.

These opportunities generally fall in three buckets:

-   Getting to minimum scope: Loops require a critical mass of inputs before they can really start spinning like you want them to.
-   Optimizing loops: Once a loop begins performing, your focus shifts to optimizing that loop.
-   Expanding loops: Last but not least, your established loops are probably driving a good bit of growth.


## Communicating Your Strategy {#communicating-your-strategy}

At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how effective your strategy is if you can't align individuals, teams, and the broader org around it.

-   Company and team mission
-   Your high-level growth model
-   Closer look at core growth loops
-   Current constraints and points of leverage
-   Potential impact if you addressed them
-   Resourcing and action items
