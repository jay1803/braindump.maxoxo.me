Jay Simons was in the center of the action. He joined Atlassian back in 2008, and under his long tenure as president, the company grew from $20 million in AAR to about $2 billion today.

he gets incredibly tactical about each leg of Atlassian’s three-pronged stool: the self-service funnel, a global network of channel partners, and enterprise upselling.


## UNCONVENTIONAL MOVE #1: BUILD ON THE BACKBONE OF PRODUCT-LED GROWTH. {#unconventional-move-1-build-on-the-backbone-of-product-led-growth-dot}

‘We want to build a product that compels people to remark upon it,’

“Even before I got there, the company’s earliest mission is characterized as building remarkable products. They were really intentional with the word ‘remarkable’ because they thought, ‘We want to build a product that compels people to remark upon it,’” he says. “Atlassian believed that we’d built a product that was easy to use and that people loved, and that was going to add to the megaphone of getting the word out about who we are and what we do.”

“The product and the business model are really married together, and that’s what we got right,” says Simons.


### Thinking self-service first. {#thinking-self-service-first-dot}

The team held a strong belief that customers wanted to help themselves, and architected everything around that self-service model. “First you have to build a great product that people can discover on their own, begin to use on their own, onboard effectively on their own. If you can’t do those things, it’s not going to work,” he says.


### Pricing that removes friction. {#pricing-that-removes-friction-dot}

“We wanted to have the product guide the customer through in the same way that a human being would if they’re sitting right alongside the customer. That meant making it easy for them to transact online and buy the product. We needed a price point that didn’t require a lot of explaining or convincing,” says Simons.


### Scaling up with a different kind of sales force. {#scaling-up-with-a-different-kind-of-sales-force-dot}

Our product advocates were absolutely focused on the success of the customer and they were there to remove whatever potholes the customer might step into. They’d answer a question on product capability, or competitive alternatives, or pricing, but with a great answer, they would then send the customer back into the self-service path,” he says.
