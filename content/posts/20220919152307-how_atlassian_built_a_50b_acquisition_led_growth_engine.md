The addressable opportunity has grown at a compounded 35% over the last 4 years and this 3x increase can be attributed to [Atlassian]({{< relref "20220711171528-atlassian.md" >}})’s investment in R&amp;D (an industry high 34% of revenue) and its acquisition-led growth engine.


## Creating over half your market cap from acquisitions {#creating-over-half-your-market-cap-from-acquisitions}

Fast forward 14 years, the company has invested north of $1B, across 18 acquisitions and 12 investments to fill product gaps (speed to market), enhance capabilities (talent and IP) and expand markets.

Atlassian’s core non-acquired businesses (Jira and Confluence) grew 4x since IPO (24% CAGR) as vs. their acquisition heavy business lines which grew at roughly 8x (38% CAGR) during the same time period!

At Atlassian, a dedicated team, working with playbooks for financial, people, and systems integration aligns the acquiree with the goals &amp; processes of the organization and streamlines an otherwise uncertain transition.


## Way Forward {#way-forward}

As Atlassian continues its push to go cloud-first; R&amp;D, product enhancements, and strategic acquisitions continue to be key levers.
