## Sample Space {#sample-space}

A [Sample Space]({{<relref "20220527121331-sample_space.md#" >}}) is a collection or a set of possible outcomes of a random
experiment. The sample space is represented using the symbol, “S”. The subset of
possible outcomes of an experiment is called events. A sample space may contain
a number of outcomes that depends on the experiment. If it contains a finite
number of outcomes, then it is known as discrete or finite sample spaces.
