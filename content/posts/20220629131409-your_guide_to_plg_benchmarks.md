## Your guide to PLG benchmarks <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#your-guide-to-plg-benchmarks}

-   It mainly reflects the last mile of the buying process, which feels short-sighted considering that just 5-6% of buying activity is spent meeting with sales reps ([data from Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey)x).
-   It assumes that “buyers” hold the power rather than users. Increasingly, [end users discover and champion products](https://openviewpartners.com/blog/age-of-connected-work/), then tell their boss what to buy.
-   It ignores product and community engagement, aka the experience with the thing that someone is actually purchasing.

The New User Journey looks something like this:

1.  Discover
2.  Start
3.  Activate
4.  Convert
5.  Scale

A few words on who was included in the data:

-   Respondents spanned all sizes from &lt;$1M to $100M+ in ARR. 24% of folks had &lt;$1M ARR, 22% had $1-5M, 26% had $5-30M, and the remaining 28% had $30M+.
-   More than half (55%) identify as product-led. This is up from 48% in 2020 and 45% in 2019.
-   Product-led companies were almost split evenly between offering a free trial or a freemium product as their initial product experience.

### Discover {#discover}

For freemium companies it's all about organic sources like SEO and direct traffic (53%) or driven by the product itself (13%). Paid marketing (10%) and outbound sales (8%) play only a small role in PLG user acquisition.

Pro-tip: [Invest in product-led marketing campaigns](https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-product-led-marketing?s=w)


### Start {#start}

For every 1,000 website visitors, freemium products get ~60 sign-ups on average (6%). Free trial products get only 30-40 sign-ups (3-4%).


### Activate {#activate}

vast majority of freemium products measure activation (76%), but it's not mainstream yet for free trial products (58%).


### Convert {#convert}

freemium products convert 5% of their sign-ups—far lower than those with a free-trial motion (17%).


### Scale {#scale}

The average freemium company in our dataset retained only 19% of their sign-ups in month 1, 11% in month 2, and 9% in month 3.
