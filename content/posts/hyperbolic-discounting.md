In economics, ****hyperbolic discounting**** is a time-\_inconsistent\_ model of  [delay discounting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay%5Fdiscounting>) . It is one of the cornerstones of  [behavioral economics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral%5Feconomics>)vand its brain-basis is actively being studied by  [neuroeconomics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroeconomics>)  researchers.
The discounted utility approach states that  [intertemporal choices](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertemporal%5Fchoice>)  are no different from other choices, except that some consequences are delayed and hence must be anticipated and discounted (i.e., reweighted to take into account the delay).
