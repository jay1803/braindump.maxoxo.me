## Definition {#definition}

SEC Form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the
SEC for public companies that are based in the U.S. Any security that meets the
criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national
exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Companies usually file SEC Form
S-1 in anticipation of their initial public offering (IPO).
Form S-1 requires
companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail
the current business model and competition and provide a brief prospectus of the
planned security itself, offering price methodology and any dilution that will
occur to other listed securities.
