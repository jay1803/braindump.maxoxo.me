## Build Something People Want {#build-something-people-want}

almost all of them have no idea that they want Slack.

“understanding what people think they want and then translating the value of Slack into their terms” is something we all work on.
We do it with copy accompanying signup forms, with fast-loading pages, with good welcome emails, with comprehensive and accurate search, with purposeful loading screens, and with thoughtfully implemented and well-functioning features of all kinds.


## “Marketing from Both Ends” {#marketing-from-both-ends}


## Sell the innovation, not the product {#sell-the-innovation-not-the-product}

The best — maybe the only? — real, direct measure of “innovation” is change in human behaviour.
That’s why what we’re selling is organizational transformation.

People buy “software” to address a need they already know they have or perform some specific task they need to perform, whether that is tracking sales contacts or editing video.

Because the best possible way to find product-market fit is to define your own market.

> 意思是要看的更大一点，如果 Slack 只是买一个沟通工具，那它和其他的沟通工具没有什么不同，但是 Slack 卖的是企业组织的转型，而不仅仅是一个沟通工具。
> 其实也就是企业定位的问题，如果你把自己定位的越具体，你的客群就越小，竞争也就越难，你之后的发展也很有局限。所以要看的更大一些，定位要宏大一些，故事要讲的更加 Epic。

My favorite recent example is Lululemon: when they started, there was not a large market for yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories. They sold yoga like crazy: helping people find yoga studios near their homes, hosting free classes, sponsorships and scholarships, local ambassadors and training, etc. And as a result, they sold just under $1.4 billion worth of yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories in their most recent fiscal year.
