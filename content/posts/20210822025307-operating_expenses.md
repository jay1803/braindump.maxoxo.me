## 营业费用 {#营业费用}

指的是运行企业的持续性、消耗性的支出，与之对照的是资本支出(capital
expenditure, CAPEX)。例如：购买影印机的支出属于资本支出(CAPEX)，而纸张、墨水、
电力、维修的费用则属于营业费用(OPEX)。在企业中，营运费用可能包含了员工薪资、设
备租金、场地租金。

Operating expenses are necessary and unavoidable for most businesses. Some
firms successfully reduce operating expenses to gain a competitive advantage
and increase earnings . However, reducing operating expenses can also
compromise the integrity and quality of operations. Finding the right balance
can be difficult but can yield significant rewards.
