On September 16 2020, [Snowflake]({{< relref "20220711171622-snowflake.md" >}}) broke the record for the largest software IPO in history. Their listing price was $120, which more than doubled during the first day, and ended up closing at $253.93

Today, they have over 3,400 customers, including notables like [Capital One]({{< relref "20221118172528-capital_one.md" >}}) and [Adobe]({{< relref "20221118172722-adobe_inc.md" >}}).


## What’s special about the product? {#what-s-special-about-the-product}

[Snowflake]({{< relref "20220711171622-snowflake.md" >}}) provides data warehousing services — “Data storage as a service”.


## Let Engineers Build, and Operators Operate {#let-engineers-build-and-operators-operate}

Snowflake was founded by three former data-warehousing stalwarts; [Benoit Dageville]({{< relref "20221118172905-benoit_dageville.md" >}}), [Thierry Cruanes]({{< relref "20221118172918-thierry_cruanes.md" >}}), and [Marcin Zukowski]({{< relref "20221118172931-marcin_zukowski.md" >}}).

[Dageville]({{< relref "20221118172905-benoit_dageville.md" >}}) and [Cruanes]({{< relref "20221118172918-thierry_cruanes.md" >}}) were former data architects at [Oracle]({{< relref "20221118173030-oracle_corporation.md" >}}), and [Zukowski]({{< relref "20221118172931-marcin_zukowski.md" >}}) a former founder of a Dutch company that went on to be acquired called Vectorwise. All three are highly technical: Zukowski co-founded Vectorwise off the back of a PhD theses titled “Balancing Vectorized Query Execution with Bandwidth-Optimized Storage”.

[Sutter Hill]({{< relref "20221118173413-sutter_hill_ventures.md" >}}) invested in Snowflake’s Series A and put one of their directors — Mike Speiser — in the CEO and CFO role.

Sutter Hill owns roughly 20.3% of Snowflake’s outstanding shares, valued at around $12.6 Billion from an initial investment of less than $200 Million.


## ‘Average’ is worse than bad {#average-is-worse-than-bad}

the current CEO of [Snowflake]({{< relref "20220711171622-snowflake.md" >}}), [Frank Slootman]({{< relref "20221118173625-frank_slootman.md" >}})
Slootman took over Data Domain as CEO when they had fewer than 20 employees, and running out of cash rapidly.
His next big move was on to [Service Now]({{< relref "20221118173955-servicenow_inc.md" >}}) where he took over as CEO in 2011, with the company sitting at $75 Million AR. Slootman took the company through an IPO and onto $1.5 Billion by 2017, by diversifying the product offering.

In his eyes, having average employees is worse than having bad ones. Bad people are easy to let go of. Average employees are not. They do their job and tick the boxes, but they don’t operate with the same amount of energy and rigour as those around them.

three lessons you can learn from Slootman:

1.  Extreme focus on the goal.
2.  Measure performance against only that goal.
3.  Raise standards.


## Go Long <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#go-long}

The strategy here is to capture market share early and sign new customers onto long-term contracts which will pay off (literally) in the long run.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20221118_174439screenshot.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 2: </span>If we look at the graph of annualized revenue run rate (earnings forecast) for each quarter after passing $100M ARRR, Snowflake is by far the best" >}}

Consider these three things before going ahead with this:

1.  Competitors
2.  Capital
3.  Long term goals.
    Is the long term play the right one? Consider the movement of your industry. Is it trending in the right direction? Is backing your horse in this race a good call, or should you be considering spending the money diversifying your income and building a more sustainable income, and company, in the long term?
