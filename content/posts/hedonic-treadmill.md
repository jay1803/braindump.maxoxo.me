享乐适应是指当环境的改变给人带来快乐时，人们通常会很快习惯这种改变。因此，一些重大生活的转变，比如加薪、结婚、搬家等都会带来一时的幸福，但只能维持很短的一段时间。
A hedonic treadmill is the tendency of a person to remain at a relatively stable level of happiness despite a change in fortune or the achievement of major goals. According to the hedonic treadmill model, as a person makes more money, their expectations and desires rise in tandem. So the rise in income results in no permanent gain in happiness. The hedonic treadmill is also referred to as the hedonistic treadmill or hedonic adaptation.
