### You Don't Need to Know It All {#you-don-t-need-to-know-it-all}

One of the beautiful things about learning any subject is the fact that you
don’t need to know everything—you only need to understand a few critically
important concepts that provide most of the value.

be in the top 1 percent of the human population when it comes to knowing:

-   How businesses actually work.
-   How to start a new business.
-   How to improve an existing business.
-   How to use business-related skills to accomplish your personal goals.


### No Experience Necessary {#no-experience-necessary}

this book does not require any prior business knowledge or experience.


### Questions, Not Answers {#questions-not-answers}

will help you ask better questions. Knowing what’s critically important in
every business is the first step in making good business decisions. The more
you know about the essential questions to ask in your current situation, the
more quickly you’ll be able to find the answers you need to move forward.


### Mental Models, Not Methods {#mental-models-not-methods}

I call these foundational business concepts mental models, and together, they
create a solid framework you can rely on to make good decisions.

Mental models are concepts that represent your understanding of “how things
work.”。


### My Personal MBA {#my-personal-mba}

Andy Walter, the first associate director I reported to at P&G, had given me:

“If you put the same amount of time and energy you’d spend completing an MBA
into doing good work and improving your skills, you’ll do just as well.”


### A Self-Directed Crash Course in Business {#a-self-directed-crash-course-in-business}

Working for P&G was an education in itself.
As time went on, however, I realized three very important things:

1.  Large companies move slowly. Good ideas often died on the vine simply
    because they had to be approved by too many people.
2.  Climbing the corporate ladder is an obstacle to doing great work. I wanted
    to focus on getting things done and making things better, not constantly
    positioning myself for promotion. Politics and turf wars are an
    inescapable part of the daily experience of working for a large company.
3.  Frustration leads to burnout. I wanted to enjoy the daily experience of
    work, but instead I felt like I was running a gauntlet each day. It began
    to affect my health, happiness, and relationships. The longer I stayed in
    the corporate world, the more I realized I wanted out. I desperately
    wanted to work on my own terms, as an entrepreneur.


### The Wheat and the Chaff {#the-wheat-and-the-chaff}

I started to wonder: how much of what’s out there—and there’s a lot out
there—I really needed to know. How could I separate the valuable information
from the rubbish?

I began tracking which resources were valuable and which ones weren’t, then
publishing my findings on my Web site, both as an archive and for the benefit
of anyone interested.


### The Personal MBA Goes Global {#the-personal-mba-goes-global}

The books themselves aren’t as important as the ideas and knowledge they
contain, but many of my readers were missing out because it took hours of
turning pages to get to the good stuff.


### Munger's Mental Models {#munger-s-mental-models}

I think it’s undeniably true that the human brain works in models. The trick
is to have your brain work better than the other person’s brain because it
understands the most fundamental models—the ones that do the most work.

—CHARLES T. MUNGER, BILLIONAIRE BUSINESS PARTNER OF WARREN BUFFETT, CEO OF
WESCO FINANCIAL, AND VICE-CHAIRMAN OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY

According to Buffett...“Charlie can analyze and evaluate any kind of deal
faster and more accurately than any man alive. He sees any valid weakness in
sixty seconds. He’s the perfect partner.”

I’ve long believed that a certain system—which almost any intelligent person
can learn—works way better than the systems most people use [to understand
the world]. What you need is a latticework of mental models in your head.
And, with that system, things gradually fit together in a way that enhances
cognition...biologist Julian Huxley’s idea that, “Life is just one damn
relatedness after another.”


### Connecting the Dots {#connecting-the-dots}

Here’s how I define a business:
Every successful business (1) creates or provides something of value that (2)
other people want or need (3) at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way
that (4) satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and (5) provides
the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to
continue operation.

Take away any of these things—value creation, customer demand, transactions,
[value delivery](#org8412d0f), or [profit](#orgdb40dbb) [sufficiency](#org376e2d3)—and you have something other than a
business. Each factor is both essential and universal.

As I deconstructed each of those factors, I found additional universal
requirements. Value can’t be created without understanding what people want
(market research). Attracting customers first requires getting their
attention, then making them interested (marketing). In order to close a sale,
people must first trust your ability to deliver on what’s promised ([value
delivery](#org8412d0f) and operations). Customer satisfaction depends on reliably exceeding
the customer’s expectations (customer [service](#org83d550b)). [Profit](#orgdb40dbb) [sufficiency](#org376e2d3) requires
bringing in more money than is spent (finance).

Every business fundamentally relies on two additional factors: people and
systems. Every business is created by people and survives by benefiting other
people in some way.

Systems, on the other hand, are the invisible structures that hold every
business together. At the core, every business is a collection of processes
that can be reliably repeated to produce a particular result.

### Should You Go to Business School? {#should-you-go-to-business-school}

Here’s the answer: five simple words that will save you years of effort and
hundreds of thousands of dollars:
Skip business school. Educate yourself.


### Three Big Problems with Business School {#three-big-problems-with-business-school}

1.  MBA programs have become so expensive you must effectively mortgage your
    life to pay the price of admission.
2.  MBA programs teach many worthless, outdated, even outright damaging
    concepts and practices
3.  MBA programs won’t guarantee you a high-paying job, let alone make you a
    skilled manager or leader with a shot at the executive suite.


### Delusions of Grandeur {#delusions-of-grandeur}

Unfortunately, daydreams and reality are often quite different.


### Your Money AND Your Life {#your-money-and-your-life}

the average cumulative debt of a student who completed an undergraduate
degree in the United States in 2009 is $22,500.

## 1. Value Creation {#1-dot-value-creation}


### 1.1 The 5 Parts of Every Business {#1-dot-1-the-5-parts-of-every-business}

Roughly defined, a business is a repeatable process that:

1.  Creates and delivers something of value…
2.  That other people want or need…
3.  At a price they’re willing to pay…
4.  In a way that satisfies the customer’s needs and expectations…
5.  So that the business brings in enough [profit](#orgdb40dbb) to make it worthwhile for the
    owners to continue operation.

it’s simply a process of identifying a problem and finding a way to solve it
that benefits both parties


### 1.2 Economically Valuable Skills {#1-dot-2-economically-valuable-skills}

If you want to improve your value as a businessperson, focus on improving
skills directly related to the Five Parts of Every Business.

Any skill or knowledge that helps you create value, market, sell, deliver
value, or manage finances is Economically Valuable


### 1.3 The Iron Law of the Market {#1-dot-3-the-iron-law-of-the-market}

Books like The New Business Road Test by John Mullins can help you identify
promising markets from the outset.


### 1.4 Core Human Drives {#1-dot-4-core-human-drives}

I prefer Clayton Alderfer’s version of Maslow’s hierarchy, which he called
“ERG theory”: people seek existence, relatedness, and growth, in that order.

Paul Lawrence and Nitin Nohria, the authors of Driven: How Human Nature
Shapes our Choices]], all human beings have four Core Human Drives that have a
profound influence on our decisions and actions:

1.  The Drive to Acquire: The desire to obtain or collect physical objects, as
    well as immaterial qualities like status, power, and influence. Businesses
    built on the drive to acquire include retailers, investment brokerages,
    and political consulting companies. Companies that promise to make us
    wealthy, famous, influential, or powerful connect to this drive.
2.  The Drive to Bond: The desire to feel valued and loved by forming
    relationships with others, either platonic or romantic. Businesses built
    on the drive to bond include restaurants, conferences, and dating
    services. Companies that promise to make us attractive, well-liked, or
    highly regarded connect to this drive.
3.  The Drive to Learn: The desire to satisfy our curiosity. Businesses built
    on the drive to learn include academic programs, book publishers, and
    training workshops. Companies that promise to make us more knowledgeable
    or competent connect to this drive.
4.  The Drive to Defend: The desire to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and
    our property. Businesses built on the drive to defend include home alarm
    systems, insurance products, martial arts training, and legal services.
    Companies that promise to keep us safe, eliminate a problem, or prevent
    bad things from happening connect to this drive.

There’s a fifth core drive that Lawrence and Nohria missed:

1.  The Drive to Feel: The desire for new sensory stimulus, intense emotional
    experiences, pleasure, excitement, entertainment, and anticipation.
    Businesses built on the drive to feel include restaurants, movies, games,
    concerts, and sporting events. Offers that promise to give us pleasure,
    thrill us, or give us something to look forward to connect with this
    drive.


### 1.5 Status Seeking {#1-dot-5-status-seeking}

We also like to ensure other people are aware of our status


### 1.6 10 Ways to Evaluate a Market {#1-dot-6-10-ways-to-evaluate-a-market}

Rate each of the ten factors below on a [scale](#org3dfdeb6) of 0 to 10, where 0 is
extremely unattractive and 10 is extremely attractive.

1.  Urgency—How badly do people want or need this right now?
2.  Market Size—How many people are actively purchasing things like this?
3.  Pricing Potential—What is the highest price a typical purchaser would be
    willing to spend for a solution?
4.  Cost of Customer Acquisition—How easy is it to acquire a new customer? On
    average, how much will it cost to generate a sale, in both money and
    effort?
5.  Cost of [Value Delivery](#org8412d0f)—How much would it cost to create and deliver the
    value offered, both in money and effort?
6.  Uniqueness of Offer—How unique is your offer versus competing offerings in
    the market, and how easy is it for potential competitors to copy you?
7.  Speed to Market—How quickly can you create something to sell?
8.  Up-Front Investment—How much will you have to invest before you’re ready
    to sell?
9.  Upsell Potential—Are there related secondary offers that you could also
    present to purchasing customers?
10. Evergreen Potential—Once the initial offer has been created, how much
    additional work will you have to put into it in order to continue
    selling?

If the score is 50 or below, move on to another idea—there are better places
to invest your energy and resources. If the score is 75 or above, you have a
very promising idea—full speed ahead


### 1.7 The Hidden Benefit of Competition {#1-dot-7-the-hidden-benefit-of-competition}

it means you know from the start there’s a market of paying customers for
this idea, eliminating your biggest risk.


### 1.8 The Mercenary Rule {#1-dot-8-the-mercenary-rule}

Even if you identify a business that will largely run itself, setting up the Systems


### 1.9 The Crusader Rule {#1-dot-9-the-crusader-rule}

changing the world is difficult if you can’t pay the bills.


### 1.10 12 Standard Forms of Value {#1-dot-10-12-standard-forms-of-value}

there’s no need to reinvent the wheel—Economic Value usually takes on one of
twelve standard forms:

1.  [[Product](#org58ac1fe)]: Create a single tangible item or entity, then sell and deliver
    it for more than what it cost to make.
2.  [[Service](#org83d550b)]: Provide help or assistance, then charge a fee for the benefits
    rendered.
3.  [Shared Resource]: Shared Resource. Create a durable asset that can be
    used by many people, then charge for access.
4.  [[Subscription](#org53496c0)]: [Subscription](#org53496c0). Offer a benefit on an ongoing basis, and
    charge a recurring fee.
5.  [[Resale](#org635eb8c)]: Acquire an asset from a wholesaler, then sell that asset to a
    retail buyer at a higher price.
6.  [[Lease](#orgf395f12)]: Acquire an asset, then allow another person to use that asset for
    a predefined amount of time in exchange for a fee.
7.  [[Agency](#orgff8b010)]: Get the attention of a group of people with certain
    characteristics, then sell access in the form of advertising to another
    business looking to reach that audience.
8.  [Loan]: Lend a certain amount of money, then collect payments over a
    predefined period of time equal to the original loan plus a predefined
    interest rate.
9.  [Option]: Offer the ability to take a predefined action for a fixed period
    of time in exchange for a fee.
10. [Insurance]: Take on the risk of some specific bad thing happening to the
    policy holder in exchange for a predefined series of payments, then pay
    out claims
11. [Capital]: Purchase an ownership stake in a business, then collect a
    corresponding portion of the [profit](#orgdb40dbb) as a one-time payout or ongoing
    dividend.

-   Distract from other, more important priorities.
-   Involve too much confusion, uncertainty, or complexity.
-   Require costly or intimidating prior experience.
-   Require specialized resources or equipment that’s difficult to obtain.

To benefit from the Hassle Premium, you need to understand how much of a hassle the task is to the prospect. The greater the hassle, the higher the potential Hassle Premium.

价值察觉
The most valuable offers do one or more of the following:

模块化
Most successful businesses offer value in multiple forms


### 1.26 Bundling and Unbundling {#1-dot-26-bundling-and-unbundling}

Bundling and Unbundling can help you create value for different types of customers without requiring the creation of something new.


### 1.27 Prototype {#1-dot-27-prototype}

原型
Ideas are cheap—what counts is the ability to translate an idea into reality, which is much more difficult than recognizing a good idea.
The more realistic your Prototype is, the easier it’ll be for people to understand what you’re trying to do.


### 1.28 Iteration Cycle {#1-dot-28-iteration-cycle}

迭代
Iteration has six major steps, which I call the WIGWAM method:

1.  Watch—What’s happening? What’s working and what’s not?
2.  Ideate—What could you improve? What are your options?
3.  Guess—Based on what you’ve learned so far, which of your ideas do you think will make the biggest impact?
4.  Which?—Decide which change to make.
5.  Act—Actually make the change.
6.  Measure—What happened? Was the change positive or negative? Should you keep the change, or go back to how things were before this iteration?

For best results, clearly define what you’re trying to accomplish with each iteration.


### 1.29 Iteration Velocity {#1-dot-29-iteration-velocity}

迭代速度
The key is to keep each iteration small, clear, and quick, basing each iteration on what you learned via previous iterations.


### 1.30 Feedback {#1-dot-30-feedback}

反馈
Getting useful Feedback from your potential customers is the core of the Iteration Cycle.
Here are a few tips to maximize the value of the Feedback you receive:

1.  Get Feedback from real potential customers instead of friends and family
2.  Ask open-ended questions
3.  Steady yourself, and keep calm
4.  Take what you hear with a grain of salt
5.  Give potential customers the opportunity to preorder

Whenever possible, give the people who are giving you Feedback the opportunity to preorder the offering


### 1.31 Alternatives {#1-dot-31-alternatives}

替代品
As you develop your offering, you can’t avoid making choices between competing Alternatives. Should


### 1.32 Trade-offs {#1-dot-32-trade-offs}

妥协
By paying attention to the Patterns behind what your best customers value, you’ll be able to focus on improving your offering for most of your best potential customers most of the time.


### 1.33 Economic Values {#1-dot-33-economic-values}

经济价值
there are nine common Economic Values that people typically consider when evaluating a potential purchase. They are:

1.  Efficacy—How well does it work?
2.  Speed—How quickly does it work?
3.  Reliability—Can I depend on it to do what I want?
4.  Ease of Use—How much effort does it require?
5.  Flexibility—How many things does it do?
6.  Status—How does this affect the way others perceive me?
7.  Aesthetic Appeal—How attractive or otherwise aesthetically pleasing is it?
8.  Emotion—How does it make me feel?
9.  Cost—How much do I have to give up to get this?

In the book Trade-Off: Why Some Things Catch On, and Others Don’t, Kevin Maney discusses these common values in terms of two primary characteristics: convenience and fidelity. Things
It’s incredibly difficult to optimize for both fidelity and convenience at the same time, so the most successful offerings try to provide the most convenience or fidelity among all competing offerings.


### 1.34 Relative Importance Testing {#1-dot-34-relative-importance-testing}

相关重要性测试

> Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter
> least.

> — JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, NINETEENTH-CENTURY DRAMATIST, POET, AND POLYMATH

As a rule, people never accept Trade-offs unless they’re forced to make a Decision
The best way to discover what people actually value is to ask them to make explicit Trade-offs during the research process
Relative Importance Testing...gives you a way to determine what people actually want by asking them a series of simple questions designed to simulate real-life Trade-offs. Here’s how it works.


### 1.35 Critical Assumptions {#1-dot-35-critical-assumptions}

关键假设 Assumption-Based Planning]]

> It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.

> —JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES, ECONOMIST

Critical Assumptions are facts or characteristics that must be true in the real world for your business or offering to be successful


### 1.36 Shadow Testing {#1-dot-36-shadow-testing}

灰度测试


### 1.37 Minimum Viable Offer {#1-dot-37-minimum-viable-offer}

最小价值提供
Since Feedback from prospective customers and paid-in-full orders are very different things, creating a Minimum Viable Offer allows you to start collecting data from real customers as quickly as possible, directly testing the idea’s Critical Assumptions and reducing the risk of making a business-ending investment decision


### 1.38 Incremental Augmentation {#1-dot-38-incremental-augmentation}

递增
Incremental Augmentation is the process of using the Iteration Cycle to add new benefits to an existing offer

## 2. Marketing {#2-dot-marketing}

Marketing is the art and science of finding “prospects”—people who are actively interested in what you have to offer.
Marketing is about getting noticed; Sales is about closing the deal.


### 2.1 Attention {#2-dot-1-attention}

Rule #1 of Marketing is that your potential customer’s available attention is limited. Keeping up with everything in your world would require way more attention than you actually have to work with.


### 2.2 Receptivity {#2-dot-2-receptivity}

接受能力
The fastest way to be ignored by anyone is to start talking about something they don’t care about.


### 2.3 Remarkability {#2-dot-3-remarkability}

Being Remarkable is the best way to attract [Attention .


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

Systems also help teams of people stay on the same page.
If you can’t systematize your process, you can’t Automate it.


## 5. Finance {#5-dot-finance}

The very best businesses create a virtuous cycle: they create huge amounts of value while keeping their expenses consistently low, so they make more than enough money to keep going without capturing too much value.

<!--list-separator-->

-  HOW TO CALCULATE

    To calculate AAC, start with...average [Lifetime Value](#org20146ef), then subtract（减去） your [Value Stream](#orgf790e35) costs—what it takes to create and deliver the value promised to that customer over your entire relationship with them. Then subtract your [Overhead](#orgfbf3fcf) divided by your total customer base, which represents the [Fixed Costs](#orgabd428f) you’ll need to pay to stay in business over that period of time. Multiply the result by 1 minus your desired [Profit Margin](#orgc33cee1)  (if you’re shooting for a 60 percent margin, you’d use 1.00 − 0.60=0.40), and that’s your AAC.

时候还是在起作用。


#### WHAT {#what}

Human biology is optimized for conditions that existed 100,000 years ago,
not for the world in which we actually live today.


#### WHY {#why}

Part of the challenge of working in the modern world is that our brains and
bodies are tuned for physical and social survival, not sixteen-hour
workdays.


### 6.2 Performance Requirements {#6-dot-2-performance-requirements}


#### WHY {#why}

If you want to get things done, you can’t run on “empty”—the human body has
Performance Requirements.


#### HOW {#how}

Eat high-quality food. [Garbage In, Garbage Out] pay attention to what you put into your body.
Exercise regularly. According to Brain Rules 让孩子的大脑自由 by John Medina,
even low-intensity physical activity increases energy, improves mental
performance, and enhances your ability to focus.

results of Pattern Matching and Mental Simulation, as well as reverse the
effects of [Willpower](#org3d68c1f) Depletion.


### 6.3 The Onion Brain {#6-dot-3-the-onion-brain}


#### WHAT {#what}

Think of the Brain as an Onion......At the core is a structure called the
**hindbrain**, which is essentially responsible for keeping you
alive......sometimes called the “lizard brain” because...generating signals
that are passed down through your spinal cord and nerves to every part of
your body, resulting in your physical actions.

Above your hindbrain is the **midbrain**, which is responsible for processing
sensory data, emotion, memory, and Pattern Matching.

Sitting just above the midbrain is a thin, folded layer of tissue—the
**forebrain**. This small sheet of neural matter is responsible for the
cognitive capabilities that make us distinctly human: self-awareness, logic,
deliberation, [Inhibition](#orgadabcd4), and Decision.

P. J. Eby...uses a great analogy to explain the relationship between the
different parts of your mind: your brain is a horse, and “you” are the
rider. Your “horse” is intelligent—it moves on its own, can identify
challenges, and will balk at things that appear dangerous or scary. “You,”
the rider, are there to set a direction and reassure the “horse” that it’s
safe to proceed.

<a id="org58ae9b1">Perceptual Control</a> 感知控制


#### WHAT {#what}

In reality, human behavior is much more like a thermostat（温度调节器）This relationship is called [Perceptual Control](#org58ae9b1)......and the action we ultimately take depends on the Environment.

The Environment dictates which actions are possible to bring the perception under control. Control is not planning—it’s adjusting to changes in the Environment as they actually happen.


#### WHY {#why}

 There are three kinds of Reference Levels: set points, ranges, and errors.

-   A set point is a minimum or maximum value......Business financial controls are managed as set points
-   A range is a spread of acceptable values.
-   An error is a set point defined as zero—any perception that’s not zero is out of control.


#### HOW {#how}

    If you want to change a behavior, you must either change the system’s [Reference Level](#org604328a) or change the Environment in which the system is operating.
Consciously defining and redefining Reference Levels can help you change your behavior.


### 6.6 Conservation of Energy {#6-dot-6-conservation-of-energy}

Conflict can be ended by scheduling firm times for work and rest, ensuring enough of each.


### 6.10 Pattern Matching {#6-dot-10-pattern-matching}


#### WHAT {#what}

Our brains are natural Pattern Matching machines. The brain is constantly busy trying to find patterns in what we perceive, then associating new patterns with other patterns that are stored in memory.

The more accurate patterns you’ve learned, the more options you have when solving new problems.


### 6.11 Mental Simulation {#6-dot-11-mental-simulation}


#### WHAT {#what}

Mental Simulation is our mind’s ability to imagine taking a specific action, then simulating the probable result before acting.

Mental Simulation relies on our memory—the database of Patterns.


#### WHY {#why}

Mental Simulation...can be used to test even the most arbitrary（武断的）actions without risk


### 6.12 Interpretation and Reinterpretation {#6-dot-12-interpretation-and-reinterpretation}

理解and重新解释

> We don’t see things as they are. We see things as we are.
> —ANAÏS NIN, AUTHOR AND DIARIST


#### WHAT {#what}

The human brain constantly relies on prior Patterns and information to make Interpretations in the absence of information.

Reinterpretation is possible because your memory is fundamentally impermanent...every time we recall a memory, it doesn’t simply resave to the same location in the same state.

In Re-Create Your Life, Morty Lefkoe teaches a process that can be used to Reinterpret past events:

1.  Identify the undesirable pattern.
2.  Name the underlying belief.
3.  Identify the source of the belief in memory, including as much sensory（感觉的）detail as possible.
4.  Describe possible alternate interpretations of the memory.
5.  Realize that your original belief is an interpretation, not reality.
6.  Consciously choose to reject the original belief as “false.”
7.  Consciously choose to accept your reinterpretation as “true.”


### 6.13 [Motivation](#orgb662b36) {#6-dot-13-motivation}

<a id="orgb662b36">Motivation</a> [动机]({{<relref "20210801234831-motivation.md#" >}})
 [Motivation](#orgb662b36) is an emotion—NOT a logical, rational activity.
[Motivation](#orgb662b36) is an emotional state that links the parts of our brain that feel with the parts that are responsible for action.

[Motivation](#orgb662b36) is the link between the [midbrain and the hindbrain.

break down the experience of [Motivation](#orgb662b36) into: moving \*toward- things that are desirable and moving \*away- from things that aren’t.

In general, “moving **away\*” takes priority over “moving \*toward**.” The reason
comes back to Caveman Syndrome.


#### WHY {#why}

Very often, Mental Simulation, Patterns, [Conflicts](#org7f60890), and Interpretation hidden in the midbrain can get in the way of making progress toward what we want to accomplish. As long as there are “move away from” signals being sent, you’ll have a hard time feeling motivated to move toward what you want.


### 6.14 [Inhibition](#orgadabcd4) {#6-dot-14-inhibition}

<a id="orgadabcd4">Inhibition</a> 拘谨，拟制


#### WHAT {#what}

[Inhibition](#orgadabcd4) is the ability to temporarily override our natural inclinations.

[Willpower](#org3d68c1f)（意志力）is the fuel of [inhibition](#orgadabcd4).


### 6.15 [Willpower](#org3d68c1f) Depletion {#6-dot-15-willpower-depletion}

<a id="org3d68c1f">Willpower</a> 意志力耗尽


#### WHAT {#what}

[Willpower](#org3d68c1f) can be thought of as instinctual override......[Willpower](#org3d68c1f) are very limited and become Depleted with use.


#### HOW TO AVOID {#how-to-avoid}

    [Willpower](#org3d68c1f) for self-control tasks is dependent on a physiological fuel: blood glucose.
The best way to use your limited reserves of [Willpower](#org3d68c1f) is to use [Guiding Structure](#orga13095d) to change the structure of your Environment instead of your behavior.


### 6.16 [Loss Aversion](#org2c18a0f) {#6-dot-16-loss-aversion}

<a id="org2c18a0f">Loss Aversion</a> [Loss Avuersion]({{<relref "20210801235104-loss_aversion.md#" >}})
 [Loss Aversion](#org2c18a0f) is the idea that people hate to lose things more than they like to gain them.


#### WHY {#why}

[Loss Aversion](#org2c18a0f) explains why threats typically take precedence over opportunities when it comes to [Motivation](#orgb662b36).

[Loss Aversion](#org2c18a0f) also explains why uncertainty appears risky.

[Loss Aversion](#org2c18a0f) is why Risk Reversal is so important if you’re presenting an offer to a potential customer.


#### HOW TO AVOID {#how-to-avoid}

The best way to overcome [Loss Aversion](#org2c18a0f) is to Reinterpret the risk of loss as "no big deal."


### 6.17 [Threat Lockdown](#org1925c69) {#6-dot-17-threat-lockdown}

<a id="org1925c69">Threat Lockdown</a>
When your mind perceives a potential threat—real or imaginary—your body immediately prepares to respond.


#### HOW BRAIN RESPONSE {#how-brain-response}

The subconscious choice to fight, flee, or freeze is largely dependent on your brain’s automatic Mental Simulation of the situation.


#### WHY {#why}

[Threat Lockdown](#org1925c69) is a constructive response designed to help you defend yourself, but like many ancient instincts, it often malfunctions（发生故障）in our modern environment.

[Threat Lockdown](#org1925c69) can easily become a vicious cycle......If you’re experiencing [Threat Lockdown](#org1925c69), don’t try to repress the threat signal.


#### HOW TO DEAL {#how-to-deal}

The key to dealing with [Threat Lockdown](#org1925c69) is to convince your mind that the threat no longer exists. You can do that in one of two ways:

-   you can convince your mind there was never actually any threat
-   you can convince your mind the threat has passed


### 6.18 Cognitive Scope Limitation {#6-dot-18-cognitive-scope-limitation}

认知范围局限

> One death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic.
> —KURT TUCHOLSKY, GERMAN SATIRIST


#### WHAT {#what}

According to Robin Dunbar, a British anthropologist, humans have the cognitive capacity to keep track of somewhere around 150 close personal connections.


#### HOW {#how}

In Green to Gold, Daniel Esty and Andrew Winston describe...The “newspaper rule” and “grandchild rule” are effective ways of personalizing the results of your decisions.

-   The “newspaper rule” is a simulation of the following: assume your decision was publicized on the front page of tomorrow’s New York Times, and your parents and/or significant other read it. What would they think?
-   The “grandchild rule” is a way of evaluating decisions with long-term consequences. Imagine that, thirty or forty years from now, your grandchild gives you feedback on the results of your decision. Will they laud you for your wisdom or reprimand you for your stupidity?


### 6.19 [Association](#orgf3cf060) {#6-dot-19-association}

<a id="orgf3cf060">Association</a> 联合，关联，联想
 For decades, the Coca-Cola Company has been associating Coke with a single emotion: happiness.


#### WHY {#why}

It’s possible to influence behavior by using associative cues, even Associations that make no logical sense.

    Correlation is powerful—your brain will make the [Association](#orgf3cf060) anyway.
Presenting your prospects with positive Associations can influence how they think about what you offer.


### 6.20 [Absence Blindness](#orgb509006) {#6-dot-20-absence-blindness}

   <a id="orgb509006">Absence Blindness</a>
   [Absence Blindness](#orgb509006) is a cognitive bias that prevents us from identifying what we can’t observe. Our perceptual faculties evolved to detect objects that are present in the Environment.
The problem is, no one sees all of the bad things that the great manager prevents.


#### WHY {#why}

[Absence Blindness](#orgb509006) makes prevention（防止）grossly（极度夸张）underappreciated.

    [Absence Blindness](#orgb509006) also makes it uncomfortable for people to "do nothing" when something bad happens, even if doing nothing is the best course of action.
Because of [Loss Aversion](#org2c18a0f), people start freaking out and start clamoring for an immediate solution to the collapsing（倒塌；垮掉）market.


#### HOW TO AVOID {#how-to-avoid}

To fix the issue, the best course of action is to stop artificially manipulating interest rates, which caused the issue in the first place.
Experience makes it easier to avoid [Absence Blindness](#orgb509006).
The only reliable way I’ve found to overcome [Absence Blindness](#orgb509006) is Checklisting.


### 6.21 Contrast {#6-dot-21-contrast}

差异，反差


#### BACKGROUD {#backgroud}

Our perceptions are influenced by information gathered from the surrounding environment.
Our perceptual（感知的；知觉的）faculties（官能，机能）are optimized to notice Contrast, not to compare what we perceive with things that aren’t there, which is the root of [Absence Blindness](#orgb509006).


#### WHY {#why}

Contrast is often used to influence buying decisions.
Framing is a way to control the perception of Contrast.


### 6.22 [Scarcity](#org2283d30) {#6-dot-22-scarcity}

<a id="org2283d30">Scarcity</a> [稀缺性]({{<relref "20210801235515-scarcity.md#" >}})


#### BACKGROUND {#background}

Because of Conservation of Energy, people have a natural tendency to decide to “do things later” unless there’s a compelling reason to act immediately.


#### WHAT {#what}

[Scarcity](#org2283d30) encourages people to make decisions quickly.
As a result, adding a [Scarcity](#org2283d30) element to your offer is a great way to encourage people to take action.


#### HOW {#how}

add an element of [Scarcity](#org2283d30) to your offer:

1.  Limited Quantities—inform prospects that you’re offering a limited number of units for sale.
2.  Price Increases—inform prospects that the price will go up in the near future.
3.  Price Decreases—inform prospects that a current discount will end in the near future.
4.  Deadlines—inform prospects that the offer is only good for a limited period of time.


### 6.23 Novelty {#6-dot-23-novelty}

新颖，新奇


#### WHAT {#what}

Novelty—the presence of new sensory data—is critical if you want to attract and maintain attention over a long period of time.


#### WHY {#why}

Even the most Remarkable object of attention gets boring over time. Human attention requires novelty to sustain itself. Continue to offer something new, and people will pay attention to what you have to offer.


## 7. Working With Yourself {#7-dot-working-with-yourself}

> To think is easy. To act is difficult. To act as one thinks is the most difficult.
> —JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, POET, DRAMATIST, AND POLYMATH

In this chapter, we’ll discuss how to decide what to do, set and achieve goals, track your daily tasks, overcome resistance, and consistently get more productive work done without burning out.


### 7.1 Akrasia {#7-dot-1-akrasia}

the state of mind in which someone acts against their better judgement through weakness of will.
Whenever you "should" do something, but resist doing it, you’re experiencing Akrasia.
Akrasia is one of the most widespread and persistent barriers to getting things done.
In my experience, Akrasia has four general parts:

-   a task
-   a desire/want
-   a should
-   an emotional experience of resistance.


#### WHY {#why}

there can be many potential sources of resistance:

-   You can’t define what you want.
-   You believe the task will bring you closer to something you don’t want.
-   You can’t figure out how you’re going to get from where you are right now to where you want to be.
-   You idealize the desired [End Result to the point that your mind estimates a low probability of achievement, resulting in [Loss Aversion](#org2c18a0f).
-   The “should” was established by someone else, not you, prompting [Persuasion Resistance.
-   A competing action in the current Environment promises immediate gratification（满足，满意）, while the reward of the task in question will come much later. (Psychologists call this Hyperbolic Discounting.)
-   The benefits of the action are abstract（抽象的）and distant（远期的）, while other possible actions will provide concrete and immediate benefits. (Psychologists call this Construal Level Theory.)


### 7.2 Monoidealism {#7-dot-2-monoidealism}

心流


#### WHAT {#what}

Monoidealism is the state of focusing your energy and attention on only one thing, without [conflicts](#org7f60890).


#### HOW {#how}

1.  Eliminate potential distractions and interruptions....Turning off my Internet connection...Using similar [Guiding Structure](#orga13095d) techniques is a good way to prevent your Attention from straying.
2.  Eliminate inner [Conflicts](#org7f60890)...Instead of trying to ignore the resistance or push through it (a surefire（万无一失）way to experience [Willpower](#org3d68c1f) Depletion), exploring that resistance using Mental Simulation and Reinterpretation helped me uncover a hidden [Conflicts](#org7f60890).
3.  Kick-start the Attention process by doing a "dash." ...setting aside ten to thirty minutes for a quick burst of focused work can make it much easier to get into the zone quickly...called the Pomodoro Technique.


### 7.3 Cognitive Switching Penalty {#7-dot-3-cognitive-switching-penalty}

意识转换处罚


#### BACKGROUND {#background}

How can you accomplish everything you need to do most effectively?
Many people rely on multitasking...Monoidealism and multitasking are complete opposites（对立面）...Every time you switch the focus of your Attention from one subject to another, you incur the Cognitive Switching Penalty.


#### WHAT {#what}

The Cognitive Switching Penalty is a Friction cost: the less you switch, the lower the cost.


#### HOW {#how}

The best approach to avoid unnecessary cognitive switching is to group similar tasks together...difficult to make progress on creative tasks between client calls.
A simple rule of thumb I use to plan my day is the 3-10-20 method: in one day, I have the capacity to finish three major tasks and ten minor tasks. A major task is any activity that requires more than twenty minutes of focused concentration


### 7.4 Four Methods of Completion {#7-dot-4-four-methods-of-completion}


#### WHAT {#what}

Four ways to “do” something: completion, deletion, delegation, and deferment.

-   Completion—doing the task
-   Deletion—eliminating the task
-   Delegation—assigning the task to someone else
-   Deferment—putting the task off until later


### 7.5 Most Important Tasks {#7-dot-5-most-important-tasks}


#### WHAT {#what}

A Most Important Task (MIT) is a critical task that will create the most important results you’re looking to achieve.
Combining this technique with [Parkinson’s Law](#orgcfc4af7) by setting an artificial deadline is extremely effective.


### 7.6 Goals {#7-dot-6-goals}


#### WHAT {#what}

Goals are most useful if they’re Framed in a Positive, Immediate, Concrete, Specific (PICS) format:

-   Positive refers to [Motivation](#orgb662b36)—your Goal should be something you move toward, not away from
-   Immediate refers to time [scale](#org3dfdeb6): your Goals should be things that you decide to make progress on now, not “someday” or “eventually.”
-   Concrete means you’re able to see the results in the real world.
-   Specific means you’re able to define exactly what, when, and where you’re going to achieve your Goal.

Goals should be under your control. Goals like “losing twenty pounds” are soul crushing because they’re not directly under your control—losing weight is a result, not an effort.
make your Goals actions that are within your [Locus of Control](#org2f5833c), like doing a minimum of thirty minutes of exercise every day and controlling the number of calories you consume.


### 7.7 States of Being {#7-dot-7-states-of-being}


#### WHAT {#what}

A State of Being is a quality of your present experience. Emotional experiences aren’t achievements because they fluctuate over time.
States of Being are decision criteria, not Goals.


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

For example, I define “being successful” as “working on things I enjoy with people I like,” “feeling free to choose what I work on,” and “having enough money to live without financial stress.”


### 7.8 Habits {#7-dot-8-habits}


#### WHAT {#what}

Habits are regular actions that support us.
Due to the power of [Accumulation](#orgae40175), small Habits can add up to huge results over time.
Most Habits take on one of four common forms: things you want to start doing, things you want to stop doing, things you want to do more, and things you want to do less.


#### HOW {#how}

Habits typically require a certain amount of [Willpower](#org3d68c1f) to create. Therefore it’s best to use the techniques we discussed in the section on [Guiding Structure](#orga13095d) to make it easier to instill the Habits you want to adopt.


### 7.9 Priming {#7-dot-9-priming}

重要性


#### WHAT {#what}

Priming is a method of consciously programming your brain to alert you when particular information is present in your Environment


#### WHY {#why}

Priming is a way to consciously influence your brain’s Pattern Matching capabilities.


#### HOW {#how}

After defining your purpose, you then pick up the book and flip through it quickly, paying particular Attention to the table of contents, section headings, and index—condensed sources of information about what the book contains and how the material is structured.


### 7.10 Decision {#7-dot-10-decision}


#### WHAT {#what}

A Decision is the act of committing to a specific plan of action.


#### WHY {#why}

Constructing（结构，构思）a system to make decisions for you is a pipe dream—all systems can do is help provide information you can use to make better decisions.
No Decision, large or small, is ever made with complete information.


#### HOW {#how}

Once [you’ve acquired 40 to 70 percent of the available information], go with your gut.”


### 7.11 Five-Fold Why {#7-dot-11-five-fold-why}


#### WHAT {#what}

The Five-Fold Why is a technique to help you discover what you actually want.
Applying the Five-Fold Why is easy: whenever you set a Goal or objective, ask yourself why you want it.


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

I want to be a millionaire

1.  Why do I want a million dollars? Because I don’t want to be stressed about money.
2.  Why don’t you want to be stressed about money? So I don’t feel anxious.
3.  Why don’t you want to feel anxious? So I feel secure.
4.  Why do you want to feel secure? So I feel free.
5.  Why do you want to feel free? Because I want to feel free.


### 7.12 Five-Fold How {#7-dot-12-five-fold-how}


#### WHAT {#what}

The Five-Fold How is a way to connect your core desires to physical actions.


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

Example: the core desire is to feel free.

1.  Paying off an outstanding debt
2.  Reducing your work hours, finding another position, or becoming an entrepreneur
3.  Moving to a new city or country
4.  Breaking off a restricting personal relationship


#### HOW {#how}

Continue asking “how” until you’ve clearly defined your plan in terms of Next Action .


### 7.13 Next Action {#7-dot-13-next-action}

Simple: focus only on the action you need to take next to move toward your Goal.
The Next Action is the next specific, concrete thing you can do right away to move a project forward.


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

David Allen, the author of Getting Things Done, coined the term to describe one of the core steps of his “fundamental process”:

1.  Write down a project or situation that is most on your mind at this moment.
2.  Now describe in a single written sentence your intended desired outcome for this problem or situation. What needs to happen to mark this “done”?
3.  Next, write down the very next physical action step required to move the situation forward.
4.  Put those answers in a system you trust.


### 7.14 Externalization {#7-dot-14-externalization}

具体化


#### WHAT {#what}

Externalization takes advantage of our perceptual abilities in a very intelligent way. By converting our internal thought processes into an external form, Externalization essentially gives us the ability to reinput information into our own brains via a different channel, which gives us access to additional cognitive resources we can use to process the same information in a different way.


#### HOW {#how}

There are two primary ways to Externalize your thoughts: writing and speaking.
Writing is the best way to capture ideas, plans, and tasks.
The key to vocal Externalization is to find an audience who is willing to listen patiently and avoid interrupting you as you talk through an issue.
Experiment with different approaches to find which method works best for you.


### 7.15 Self-Elicitation {#7-dot-15-self-elicitation}

自我诱导


#### WHAT {#what}

Self-Elicitation is the practice of asking yourself questions, then answering them.


#### HOW {#how}

The Five-Fold How and Five-Fold Why are specific examples of Self-Elicitation.
The ABC Method (Antecedent（前因）, Behavior, Consequences) is a set of questions to ask yourself whenever you notice a behavior you want to change.


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

ANTECEDENT

-   When did it happen?
-   Whom were you with?
-   What were you doing?
-   Where were you?
-   What were you saying to yourself?
-   What thoughts were you having?
-   What feelings were you having?

BEHAVIOR

-   What were you saying to yourself?
-   What thoughts did you have?
-   What feelings were you having?
-   What actions were you performing?

CONSEQUENCES

-   What happened as a result?
-   Was it pleasant or unpleasant?


### 7.16 Counterfactual Simulation {#7-dot-16-counterfactual-simulation}

反事实模拟


#### WHAT {#what}

Counterfactual Simulation allows you to “force” your brain to run the simulations you want it to run.


#### WHY {#why}

Counterfactual Simulation can help you discover hidden opportunities you may have previously assumed weren’t possible.


#### HOW {#how}

When you run a Counterfactual Simulation, you assume the event or end state you’re simulating is already true. By supplying your mind with an artificial destination, it will automatically start to fill in the blanks between point A and point B.


### 7.17 [Parkinson’s Law](#orgcfc4af7) {#7-dot-17-parkinson-s-law}

帕金森定理 <a id="orgcfc4af7">Parkinson’s Law</a>

> Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
> —CYRIL NORTHCOTE PARKINSON, NAVAL HISTORIAN AND MANAGEMENT THEORIST


#### WHAT {#what}

[Parkinson’s Law](#orgcfc4af7) should not be considered carte blanche to set unreasonable deadlines.


#### HOW {#how}

[Parkinson’s Law](#orgcfc4af7) is best used as a Counterfactual Simulation question.


### 7.18 [Doomsday Scenario](#org18efb93) {#7-dot-18-doomsday-scenario}

全球灾难危机 <a id="org18efb93">Doomsday Scenario</a>


#### WHAT {#what}

A [Doomsday Scenario](#org18efb93) is a Counterfactual Simulation) where you assume everything that can go wrong does go wrong.


#### WHY {#why}

Doomsday Scenarios are pessimistic for a reason—they help you realize that, in most circumstances, you’re going to be okay.


#### HOW {#how}

When you actually examine your worst fears, you’ll discover that things won’t be as bad as you fear.
By intentionally Externalizing and defining your worst fears, you’re exposing them as what they really are: irrational overreactions.
Once you’ve imagined your [Doomsday Scenario](#org18efb93), you can start doing things to improve upon the worst case.


### 7.19 Excessive Self-Regard Tendency {#7-dot-19-excessive-self-regard-tendency}

过于自我的趋势


#### WHAT {#what}

Excessive Self-Regard Tendency is the natural tendency to overestimate your own abilities, particularly if you have little experience with the matter at hand.


#### WHY {#why}

The Excessive Self-Regard Tendency is even more pronounced if you don’t know much about the subject at hand. The more incompetent a person is, the less they realize they’re incompetent.


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

They explain the Dunning-Kruger Effect as follows:

1.  Incompetent individuals tend to overestimate their own level of skill.
2.  Incompetent individuals fail to recognize genuine skill in others.
3.  Incompetent individuals fail to recognize the extremity of their inadequacy.
4.  If they can be trained to substantially improve their own skill level, these individuals can recognize and acknowledge their own previous lack of skill.


### 7.20 [Confirmation Bias](#org247a4f7) {#7-dot-20-confirmation-bias}

<a id="org247a4f7">Confirmation Bias</a> [确认偏误]({{<relref "20210802000043-confirmation_bias.md#" >}})


#### WHAT {#what}

[Confirmation Bias](#org247a4f7) is the general tendency for people to pay Attention to information that supports their conclusions and ignore information that doesn’t.


#### HOW {#how}

The best way to counteract（抵制）[Confirmation Bias](#org247a4f7) is to intentionally seek out sources of information that challenge your current hypothesis or belief.


### 7.21 [Hindsight Bias](#org864f96d) {#7-dot-21-hindsight-bias}

[后视偏差]({{<relref "20210802000158-hindsight_bias.md#" >}}) <a id="org864f96d">Hindsight Bias</a>


#### WHAT {#what}

[Hindsight Bias](#org864f96d) is the natural tendency to kick yourself for things you “should have known.”


#### WHY {#why}

It’s important to realize that these feelings are irrational—your decisions were based on the best information you had at the time.


#### HOW {#how}

As the saying goes, “Hindsight is 20-20.” Reinterpret your past mistakes in a constructive light, and focus your energy on what you can do right now to move in a positive direction.


### 7.22 Performance Load {#7-dot-22-performance-load}


#### WHAT {#what}

Performance Load is a concept that explains what happens when you have too many things to do.


#### HOW {#how}

Remember [Parkinson’s Law](#orgcfc4af7): if you don’t set a limit on your available time, your work will expand to fill it all.


### 7.23 Energy Cycles {#7-dot-23-energy-cycles}


#### WHAT {#what}

Your body has natural rhythms during the day, which I call Energy Cycles.


#### WHY {#why}

Paying attention to your natural Energy Cycle will help you consistently perform at your best over long periods of time.


#### HOW {#how}

Here are four simple ways to work with your body instead of against it.

1.  Learn Your Patterns—Use a notebook or calendar to track how much energy you have during different parts of the day, as well as what you’re eating and drinking.
2.  2. Maximize Your Peak Cycles—When you’re in an up cycle, you’re capable of getting a lot accomplished, so plan your day to take advantage of that energy.
3.  Take a Break—When you’re in a down cycle, it’s better to rest than attempt to power through it.
4.  Get Enough Sleep—Sleep deprivation results in a prolonged down cycle, which gets in the way of getting things done.


### 7.24 Stress and Recovery {#7-dot-24-stress-and-recovery}


#### WHY {#why}

Paying attention to Stress and Recovery ensures that I don’t take on too much to handle.
It’s impossible to know how much you’re capable of until you decide to push your limits. As long as you stay safe by limiting your Experimentation to things that won’t kill you or do permanent damage, you can learn a ton about how you work by stretching yourself to the limit.


#### HOW {#how}

The less overlap between your hobby and your work, the better.


### 7.25 Testing {#7-dot-25-testing}


#### WHAT {#what}

Testing is the act of trying something new—a way of applying the scientific method and the Iteration Cycle to your own life.


#### HOW {#how}

Here’s a simple structure that will help you plan and track your Experiments:

-   Observations—What are you observing in your life or business that you want to improve?
-   Knowns—What have you learned from past Experiments that might be related to your observations?
-   Hypotheses—Based on what you’ve observed, what situations or factors might cause or contribute to your observations?
-   Tests—What will you try or change to improve your situation? Which hypotheses will this experiment Test?
-   Results—What happened after each Test? Does it support or disconfirm the hypothesis?

Here are a few questions to help you discover things worth Testing:

-   How much sleep do you need to feel rested and alert?
-   Which foods make you feel energetic after eating? Which foods make you feel ill or lethargic?
-   When do you do your most productive work? Are there any patterns in your productivity?
-   When do you get your best ideas? What are you doing when they occur to you?
-   What is your biggest source of stress or concern? When do you start worrying, and why?

Once you’ve found a Pattern in one of these areas, it’s time to start Experimenting.


### 7.26 Mystique {#7-dot-26-mystique}

神秘色彩


#### WHAT {#what}

Mystique is a powerful force—a little mystery makes most things appear to be a lot more attractive than they actually are.


#### HOW TO IDENTIFY {#how-to-identify}

Here’s what to ask: “I really respect what you’re doing, but I imagine it has high points and low points. Could you share them with me? Knowing what you know now, is it worth the effort?”


### 7.27 Hedonic Treadmill {#7-dot-27-hedonic-treadmill}

愉悦 乏味


#### WHAT {#what}

This cycle is called the Hedonic Treadmill: we pursue pleasurable things because we think they’ll make us happy. When we finally achieve or acquire what we’re seeking, we adapt to our success in a very short period of time, and our success no longer gives us pleasure. As a result, we begin seeking something new, and the cycle repeats.


#### WHY {#why}

The Hedonic Treadmill is a major problem if you’d like to experience a feeling of success or achievement for an extended period of time.


#### HOW {#how}

here are five priorities that will contribute to your long-term happiness in a way that minimizes hedonic adaptation:

1.  Work to make “enough” money...Once you have enough money to cover the necessities and a few luxuries, you reach a point of [Diminishing Returns](#org88bb41a): every additional dollar you earn doesn’t provide the same amount of utility.
2.  Focus on improving your health and energy.
3.  Spend time with people you enjoy.
4.  Remove chronic annoyances（长久的烦恼）...Examining ways to reduce or eliminate chronic stresses or annoyances can generate significant improvements in life satisfaction.
5.  Pursue a new challenge.


### 7.28 Comparison Fallacy {#7-dot-28-comparison-fallacy}

比较谬论


#### BACKGROUND {#background}

We tend to fixate on what other people are accomplishing instead of what we need to do next to achieve our Goals.


#### WHAT {#what}

The Comparison Fallacy is a simple idea: other people are not you, and you are not other people.


#### HOW {#how}

The only metric of success that matters is this: are you spending your time doing work you like, with people you enjoy, in a way that keeps you financially Sufficient)? If so, don’t worry about what other people are doing. If not, focus on making changes that are within your [Locus of Control](#org2f5833c), so you can start moving in the direction you desire.


### 7.29 [Locus of Control](#org2f5833c) {#7-dot-29-locus-of-control}

控制点 <a id="org2f5833c">Locus of Control</a>


#### WHAT {#what}

Understanding your [Locus of Control](#org2f5833c) is being able to separate what you can control (or strongly influence) from what you can’t. Trying to control things that aren’t actually under your control is a recipe for eternal frustration.


#### HOW {#how}

Focusing on your efforts helps you stay sane—turning results you don’t directly control into Goals is a recipe for frustration.


### 7.30 Attachment {#7-dot-30-attachment}

爱慕，附加


#### WHAT {#what}

When something outside of our [Locus of Control](#org2f5833c) affects our plans or Goals, it’s easy to take it personally.
The more Attached you are to a particular idea or plan, the more you limit your flexibility and reduce your chances of finding a better solution.


#### HOW {#how}

Acceptance requires applying the concept of [Sunk Cost](#org2adc460) to yourself.
The solution to Attachment is accepting that your idea or plan is no longer feasible or useful. The less Attached you are to your plans, Goals, status, and position, the easier it will be to respond appropriately to inevitable change or unforeseen circumstances.


### 7.31 Personal Research and Development {#7-dot-31-personal-research-and-development}


#### WHAT {#what}

Research and Development (R&D) is what business leaders around the world count on to determine what the company should work on next.


#### WHY {#why}

R&D exists because it works—companies that make Research and Development a priority often discover new products to offer their customers or process improvements that meaningfully contribute to the bottom line.


#### HOW {#how}

Using the techniques discussed in I Will Teach You to Be Rich by Ramit Sethi, it’s remarkably easy to automatically divert a certain amount of your monthly income into an account earmarked for Personal R&D.


### 7.32 Limiting Belief {#7-dot-32-limiting-belief}

习得性无助 <a id="orgc25a905">Learned Helplessness</a>


#### BACKGROUND {#background}

In general, there are two primary ways of looking at the world—two mind-sets that influence your response to new experiences.

-   The first basic mind-set is that your skills and abilities are fixed. If you try something and it doesn’t work, it’s because you’re “not good at that,” and you never will be.
-   The second basic mind-set is that your skills and abilities are malleable. If you try something and it doesn’t work, it’s because you haven’t worked on it very much, but if you keep trying, you’ll inevitably get better.

The fixed mind-set is an example of a Limiting Belief: something you believe is true about the world that holds you back from achieving a Goal you value. The fixed mind-set isn’t true, but it’s capable of holding you back if you choose to believe it.

  Some Limiting Beliefs are the result of errors in Pattern Matching.
Everyone has Limiting Beliefs in certain areas. Anytime you use the words “I can’t,” “I have to,” or “I’m not good at,” you’ve discovered a potential Limiting Belief.
Limiting Beliefs may also appear when you consider doing things that make you uncomfortable, like applying for a new job or selling an offer to a new prospect.


#### HOW {#how}

Here’s a useful rule of thumb for these types of situations: make the other party tell you no. This is a Habit worth installing: you may believe you’re going to be turned down when you make a request or propose an idea, but make the other party say it instead of assuming it’s a given.


## 8. Working With Others {#8-dot-working-with-others}

In this chapter, we’ll discuss how to work effectively with others. You’ll learn how to communicate more effectively, earn the respect and trust of others, recognize the limitations and pitfalls of group interactions, and lead or manage a team of people effectively.


### 8.1 Power {#8-dot-1-power}


#### BACKGROUND {#background}

human relationships are based on Power—the ability to influence the actions of other people...influence is much more effective than compulsion（强迫）.


#### WHY {#why}

Power represents your ability to get things done through other people—the more power you have, the more things you can do.


#### HOW {#how}

The best way to increase your Power is to do things that increase your influence and Reputation.


### 8.2 [Comparative Advantage](#orgb019774) {#8-dot-2-comparative-advantage}

比较优势 <a id="orgb019774">Comparative Advantage</a>


#### BACKGROUND {#background}

Why work with other people in the first place? The answer is [Comparative Advantage](#orgb019774), a concept that originated in the “dismal science” of economics.


#### WHAT {#what}

[Comparative Advantage](#orgb019774) means it’s better to capitalize on your strengths than to shore up your weaknesses.


#### WHY {#why}

businesses work better if the individuals who operate them focus on what they’re best at.
The major benefit of self-education when working with others is knowing what skill looks like.


### 8.3 Communication [Overhead](#orgfbf3fcf) {#8-dot-3-communication-overhead}

过度沟通


#### WHAT {#what}

Communication [Overhead](#orgfbf3fcf) is the proportion of time you spend communicating with members of your team instead of getting productive work done.


#### HOW TO IDENTIFY {#how-to-identify}

Symptoms of Bureaucratic Breakdown that appear in teams suffering from Communication [Overhead](#orgfbf3fcf):

1.  The Invisible Decision—No one knows how or where decisions are made, and there is no transparency in the decision-making process.
2.  Unfinished Business—Too many tasks are started but very few are carried through to the end.
3.  Coordination Paralysis—Nothing can be done without checking with a host of interconnected units.
4.  Nothing New—There are no radical ideas, inventions, or lateral thinking—a general lack of initiative.
5.  Pseudo-Problems—Minor issues become magnified out of all proportion.
6.  Embattled Center—The center battles for consistency and control against local/regional units.
7.  Negative Deadlines—The deadlines for work become more important than the quality of the work being done.
8.  Input Domination—Individuals react to inputs—i.e., whatever gets put in their in-tray—as opposed to using their own initiative.


#### HOW TO RESOLVE {#how-to-resolve}

The solution to Communication [Overhead](#orgfbf3fcf) is simple but not easy: make your team as small as possible. You’ll be leaving people out, but that’s the point—including them is causing more work than it’s creating in benefits.
Studies of effective teamwork usually recommend working in groups of three to eight people.


### 8.4 Importance {#8-dot-4-importance}


#### HOW {#how}

The more Important you make them feel, the more they’ll value their relationship with you.
The more interest you take in other people, the more Important they will feel.
The more Important you make people feel when they’re around you


### 8.5 Safety {#8-dot-5-safety}

Effective communication can only occur when both parties feel safe.


#### HOW {#how}

...using the STATE model to communicate without provoking anger or defensiveness:

1.  Share your facts—Facts are less controversial, more persuasive, and less insulting than conclusions, so lead with them first.
2.  Tell your story—Explain the situation from your point of view, taking care to avoid insulting or judging, which makes the other person feel less safe.
3.  Ask for others’ paths—Ask for the other person’s side of the situation, what they intended, and what they want.
4.  Talk tentatively—Avoid conclusions, judgments, and ultimatums.
5.  Encourage testing—Make suggestions, ask for input, and discuss until you reach a productive and mutually satisfactory course of action.


### 8.6 Golden Trifecta {#8-dot-6-golden-trifecta}


#### QUESTIONS {#questions}

If people have a fundamental need to feel Important and Safe, how do you go about making that happen?


#### WHAT {#what}

The Golden Trifecta is my personal three-word summary of How to Win Friends and Influence People...always remember to treat people with appreciation, courtesy, and respect.

-   \*Appreciation\*（感谢，欣赏，评价） means expressing your gratitude for what others are doing for you, even if it’s not quite perfect.
-   \*Courtesy\*（礼貌） is politeness, pure and simple.
-   \*Respect\*（尊重） is a matter of honoring the other person’s status.


### 8.7 Reason Why {#8-dot-7-reason-why}

Humans are predisposed to look for behavioral causes. People will be more receptive to any request if you give them a reason why. Any reason will do.


### 8.8 Commander’s Intent {#8-dot-8-commander-s-intent}


#### WHAT {#what}

Commander’s Intent is a much better method of delegating tasks: whenever you assign a task to someone, tell them why it must be done.


#### WHY {#why}

Commander’s Intent alleviates（减轻，缓解）Communication [Overhead](#orgfbf3fcf). By communicating the intent behind a certain plan, a leader can make constant communication less critical for the success of the entire team.


### 8.9 Bystander Apathy {#8-dot-9-bystander-apathy}

旁观者效应 <a id="orgda5e011">Bystander Effect</a>


#### BACKGROUD {#backgroud}

two useful principles from this training:

1.  always personally step up and take responsibility, unless relieved by a more experienced professional.
2.  always direct commands or requests very clearly to one specific individual at a time.


#### WHAT {#what}

Bystander Apathy is an inverse relationship between the number of people who could take action and the number of people who actually choose to act.


#### WHY {#why}

Bystander Apathy explains why anything assigned to a committee（委员会） never gets done.


#### HOW {#how}

The best way to eliminate Bystander Apathy in project management is to ensure that all tasks have single, clear owners and deadlines.
When delegating responsibilities, always assign tasks to a single owner with a clear deadline.


### 8.10 Planning Fallacy {#8-dot-10-planning-fallacy}

When we create plans, we’re simply guessing and using Interpretation to fill in the blanks.


#### WHY SHOULD CARE {#why-should-care}

The Planning Fallacy means that people have a persistent tendency to underestimate completion times. The more complex the project, the more Interdependencies (discussed later) the project contains.


#### HOW {#how}

Use plans, but don’t depend on them—as long as you keep working as quickly and effectively as possible, the project will be done as soon as it’s feasible.


### 8.11 Referrals {#8-dot-11-referrals}

参考，推介


#### WHAT {#what}

Referrals make it far easier for people to Decide to work with someone they don’t know.


#### WHY {#why}

Referrals are effective because they transfer the qualities of being known and liked.
The Referral transfers the knowing/liking effect to the recipient—instead of being a risky unknown quantity, they’re suddenly a friend.
The more people who know, like, and trust you, the better off you are


### 8.12 Clanning {#8-dot-12-clanning}


#### WHAT {#what}

Humans naturally tend to form distinct groups, a process called Clanning.
Distinct group identities formed to help members identify “insiders” and “outsiders.”
Clanning is a natural human tendency—we’re automatically and profoundly influenced by the people around us.


### 8.13 Convergence and Divergence {#8-dot-13-convergence-and-divergence}

趋同与分歧


#### WHAT {#what}

Convergence is the tendency of group members to become more alike over time. In business, this is sometimes called a company “culture,” in the sense that people who work there tend to have similar characteristics, behaviors, and philosophies.
Convergence also means that groups have a tendency to police themselves. The Norms) of the group work like gravity—if they are violated, others will exert an influence on the rebel to bring them back in line. the Norms is a Social Signal that you don’t belong in the group
Divergence is the tendency for groups to become less like other groups over time.
Divergence explains why fashions among the socialite class in New York City change so quickly and dramatically.
Convergence can be useful if you consciously choose to spend time with people you’d like to become more like over time.


### 8.14 Social Signals {#8-dot-14-social-signals}

社交信号 <a id="org3de9d57">Signalling Theory</a>


#### WHAT {#what}

Social Signals are tangible indicators of some intangible quality that increases a person’s social status or group affiliation.


#### WHY {#why}

Signals sometimes have little or nothing to do with the reality of what the signal is supposed to communicate.
Social signals have real Economic Values, so it pays to build them into your offer if you can. Part of building a signaling value into something is understanding what people want to signal to others. Since signals go back to the Core Human Drives.


### 8.15 Social Proof {#8-dot-15-social-proof}

Social Proof can take on a life of its own. Fads often form when one person
takes an action, others perceive it as a Social Signal [Signalling Theory](#org3de9d57),
then act the same way, creating a social Feedback Loop.


### 8.16 Authority {#8-dot-16-authority}

权威


#### WHAT {#what}

People tend to comply with Authority figures even if they’d refuse to take the same action under normal circumstances.
If you’re in a position of Authority, your Authority will change the way others interact with you...more likely to do what you suggest.
the combination of Authority and [Confirmation Bias](#org247a4f7) shelters them from information that contradicts their opinions...it’s difficult for Authority figures to compensate for the Excessive Self-Regard Tendency.


### 8.17 Commitment and Consistency {#8-dot-17-commitment-and-consistency}

Commitments have been used throughout history as a way of binding groups together. Breaking a promise or Commitment can often have a negative impact on social status and Reputation, so most people will do whatever they can to act in ways that are Consistent with previous positions and promises.


#### HOW {#how}

Obtaining small Commitments makes it more likely people will choose to act Consistently with them later.


### 8.18 Incentive-Caused Bias {#8-dot-18-incentive-caused-bias}


#### WHAT {#what}

Incentive-Caused Bias explains why people with a vested interest in something will tend to guide you in the direction of their interest.


#### HOW {#how}

Incentives automatically influence the way people act, based on how they’re rewarded.
Sometimes incentives create unintended Second-Order Effects.
Incentives are tricky because they inevitably interact with our [Perceptual Control](#org58ae9b1) systems.


### 8.19 [Modal Bias](#orgd94fe3e) {#8-dot-19-modal-bias}

   <<a id="orgd94fe3e">Modal Bias</a>
    [Modal Bias](#orgd94fe3e) is the automatic assumption that our idea or approach is best.
Most of us like to assume we have everything together—that we know what we’re talking about, we know what we’re doing, and that our way of doing things is best. Very often, we are quite mistaken.


#### HOW TO AVOID {#how-to-avoid}

The best way to avoid [Modal Bias](#orgd94fe3e) is to use [Inhibition](#orgadabcd4)（拟制）to temporarily suspend judgment.
Part of the value of understanding cognitive biases is the knowledge that you’re not immune to them, and simply knowing they exist doesn’t make them any less influential.


### 8.20 Pygmalion Effect {#8-dot-20-pygmalion-effect}

皮格马利翁效应


#### WHY {#why}

The Pygmalion Effect explains why all of our relationships are, in a very real sense, self-fulfilling prophecies.
The [Expectation Effect](#org34be4f1) means that our perception of the quality of someone’s work is a function of our original expectations.


### 8.21 Attribution Error {#8-dot-21-attribution-error}

归因谬误


#### WHAT {#what}

The Attribution Error means that when others screw up, we blame their character; when we screw up, we attribute the situation to circumstances.
Avoiding the Attribution Error makes it easier to stay on good terms with the people you work with.


### 8.22 Option Orientation {#8-dot-22-option-orientation}

定向


#### BACKGROUD {#backgroud}

By the time you’re aware of an issue, preventing it is beyond your [Locus of Control](#org2f5833c). The issue has already occurred—the only question is how you plan to respond to it.


#### HOW {#how}

Instead of dwelling on the problem, focus on your Options.
Focus on Options, not issues, and you’ll be able to handle any situation life throws at you.


### 8.23 Management {#8-dot-23-management}


#### WHAT {#what}

Management is the act of coordinating a group of people to achieve a specific Goal while accounting for ever-present Change and Uncertainty.


#### HOW {#how}

Based on what we’ve learned thus far, here are six simple principles of effective real-world Management:

1.  Recruit the smallest group of people who can accomplish what must be done quickly and with high quality. [Comparative Advantage](#orgb019774) means that some people will be better than others at accomplishing certain tasks, so it pays to invest time and resources in recruiting the best team for the job.
2.  Clearly communicate the desired End Result, who is responsible for what, and the current status.
3.  Treat people with respect. Consistently using the Golden Trifecta—appreciation, courtesy, and respect—is the best way to make the individuals on your team feel Important and is also the best way to ensure that they respect you as a leader and manager.
4.  Create an Environment where everyone can be as productive as possible, then let people do their work.
5.  Refrain from having unrealistic expectations regarding certainty and prediction.
6.  Measure to see if what you’re doing is working—if not, try another approach.

The best managers don’t act like big-shot executives: they’re more like very skilled assistants, whose primary purpose is to keep the people with Economically Valuable Skills focused on improving The 5 Parts of Every Business): that is, doing things that directly contribute to the company’s results.

> The “management team” isn’t the “decision making” team. It’s a support function. You may want to call them administration instead of management, which will keep them from getting too big for their britches.


### 8.24 Performance-Based Hiring {#8-dot-24-performance-based-hiring}

Here’s the golden rule of hiring: the best predictor of future behavior is past performance. If you want to hire people who will perform well for you in the months and years to come, you need to look for people who have performed well in the past.


#### HOW {#how}

The first step in hiring is to publicize that you’re looking for help.
Next, identify a basic “acid test” to screen applicants...ask a few basic questions that require a certain amount of specialized knowledge in the field to answer.
Finally, give promising candidates a short-turnaround project or scenario to see how they think, work, and communicate firsthand.
Don’t put the candidate in an artificial environment: they should be free to use whatever tools or resources they’re comfortable using.
The purpose of the project or scenario is to evaluate the candidate’s actual work in a realistic environment. What does the candidate focus on first? What do they notice, and what do they miss? How do they explain their choices and recommendations? How do they respond when you ask questions or disagree with a conclusion?


## 9. Understanding Systems {#9-dot-understanding-systems}

In this chapter, you’ll learn common elements of all systems, how Environmental factors influence the function of systems, and the ever-present nature of Uncertainty and Change.


### 9.1 Gall’s Law {#9-dot-1-gall-s-law}

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: a complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a simple system.
> —JOHN GALL, SYSTEMS THEORIST


#### WHAT {#what}

Here’s Gall’s Law: all complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems
that worked. Complex systems are full of variables and Interdependence that must be arranged just right in order to function.
Uncertainty ensures that you will never be able to anticipate all of these Interdependences and variables in advance, so a complex system built from scratch will continually fail in all sorts of unexpected ways.


#### WHY {#why}

Gall’s Law is where environmental Selection Tests meet systems design.
Gall’s Law is why [Prototyping and [Iteration work so well as a [Value Creation methodology.
Expanding that [Prototype into a [Minimum Viable Offer allows you to validate your [Critically Important Assumptions, resulting in the simplest possible system that can succeed with actual purchasers. Iteration and Incremental Augmentation, over time, will produce extremely complex systems that actually work, even as the Environment changes.


### 9.2 Flow {#9-dot-2-flow}


#### WHAT {#what}

Flows—movements of resources into and out of the system.
Inflows are resources moving into a system.
Outflows are resources flowing out of a system.


#### WHY {#why}

Follow the Flows, and you’re on your way to understanding how the system works.


### 9.3 Stock {#9-dot-3-stock}

库存


#### WHAT {#what}

Stocks are pools of resources, it pays to understand how many resources you have to work with.


#### HOW TO USE {#how-to-use}

To increase a Stock, increase Inflows and/or decrease Outflows.
To decrease a Stock, decrease Inflows and/or increase Outflows.


### 9.4 Slack {#9-dot-4-slack}

存活
Slack is the amount of resources present in a Stock.


#### WHY {#why}

For a System to operate efficiently, Stocks should be just the right size—not too big, and not too small.
Large Stocks have the most Slack, but that flexibility comes at a cost...which increases your costs and decreases your [[Profit Margin](#orgc33cee1).


#### HOW TO MANAGE {#how-to-manage}

Slack is tricky to manage: too much, and you’re wasting time and money. Too little, and your system faces the risk of running out of the resources necessary to continue operating.


### 9.5 Constraint {#9-dot-5-constraint}

限制，强迫


#### WHAT {#what}

Theory of Constraints: any manageable system is always limited in achieving more of its [Goals by at least one Constraint. If you can identify and alleviate the Constraint, you’ll increase the [Throughput](#org248bcbf) of the system.


#### HOW TO ELIMINATE {#how-to-eliminate}

Goldratt proposes the “Five Focusing Steps,” a method you can use to improve the [Throughput](#org248bcbf) of any System:

1.  Identification: examining the system to find the limiting factor.
2.  Exploitation（利用）: ensuring that the resources related to the Constraint aren’t wasted.
3.  Subordination（从属）: redesigning the entire system to support the Constraint.
4.  Elevation（提升）: permanently increasing the capacity of the Constraint
5.  Reevaluation: after making a change, reevaluating the system to see where the Constraint is located


### 9.6 Feedback Loop {#9-dot-6-feedback-loop}


#### WHAT {#what}

Feedback Loops exist whenever the output of a System becomes one of the inputs in the next cycle.
Feedback is how systems learn—if the system is capable of perceiving（察觉）its Environment, that feedback helps the system understand whether it’s under control and satisfying the required [Selection Tests .
Balancing Loops dampen（稳定，对…泼冷水）each system cycle’s output, leading to system equilibrium（均衡）and resistance（抵制）to change.
Balancing Loops stabilize the system, dampening oscillations and keeping the system in a certain state. [Perceptual Control](#org58ae9b1) systems are usually made up of Balancing Loops.
Reinforcing Loops Amplify the system’s output with each system cycle.
[Compounding](#orgdd64a8e) is an example of a positive Reinforcing Loop


### 9.7 Autocatalysis {#9-dot-7-autocatalysis}

An Autocatalyzing System produces the inputs necessary for the next cycle as a by-[product](#org58ac1fe) of the previous cycle, Amplifying the cycle. Autocatalysis is a [Compounding](#orgdd64a8e), positive, self-reinforcing Feedback Loop—the system will continue to grow until the system changes in a way that produces less output.


### 9.8 Environment {#9-dot-8-environment}


#### BACKGROUD {#backgroud}

Every system is inevitably affected by all of the other systems around it.


#### WHAT {#what}

An Environment is the structure in which a system operates. The Environment primarily influences or impacts the system’s Flows or processes, changing the output of the system.


### 9.9 Selection Test {#9-dot-9-selection-test}

选拔考试


#### BACKGROUND {#background}

Self-perpetuating（使持续） Systems (like businesses or organisms（有机体）) can only self-perpetuate as long as they meet the Environmental conditions necessary to exist.


#### WHAT {#what}

A Selection Test is an Environmental constraint that determines which Systems continue to self-perpetuate and which ones “die.”
As the [Environment changes, the Selection Tests change as well


### 9.10 Uncertainty {#9-dot-10-uncertainty}


#### WHAT {#what}

Risks are known unknowns.
Uncertainties are unknown unknowns.


#### WHY SHOULD CARE {#why-should-care}

You can’t reliably predict the future based on past events in the face of Uncertainty.
No matter how stable or predictable things seem, unpredictable “black swan events” can change everything in an instant.
A black swan eventBlack Swan Theory, the probability of its occurring is a moot point: the event changes the Environment in which the system operates, sometimes drastically changing Selection Tests without warning.
Discounted Cash Flow (NPV), or Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) model is only as good as the quality of your predictions.
Absorbing（吸引人的）the ever-present nature of Uncertainty is an exercise in seeing the world as it really is, not as we want it to be. Instinctually, we all want to feel like we know what will happen in the future, particularly given how prone we are to [[Loss Aversion](#org2c18a0f) and [[Threat Lockdown](#org1925c69).


### 9.11 Change {#9-dot-11-change}


#### WHAT {#what}

All systems Change—there is no such thing as a System in stasis.
Because of our natural [Pattern Matching abilities, we tend to see patterns where none exist and tend to attribute random Changes to skill if the Changes are good or misfortune if they’re bad.


### 9.12 Interdependence {#9-dot-12-interdependence}

相互依赖


#### WHAT {#what}

Complex Systems almost always rely on other systems in order to operate.


#### WHY {#why}

The more tightly coupled the processes in a system are, the more likely failures or delays will affect other parts of the system.
Tightly coupled systems are typically time dependent, rigidly ordered, and have very little [Slack.


#### HOW {#how}

You can make a system less Interdependent by removing dependencies. A dependency is an input that’s required before the next stage of a process can take place. The more dependencies there are in a system, the higher the likelihood of delay or system failure.


### 9.13 Counterparty Risk {#9-dot-13-counterparty-risk}

信用风险 <a id="org7a02bea">Credit Risk</a>


#### WHAT {#what}

Counterparty risk is the possibility that other people won’t deliver what they have promised.


#### WHY {#why}

Too much Counterparty Risk increases the risk of catastrophic system failure.
Counterparty Risk is [Amplified by the [Planning Fallacy.


### 9.14 Second-Order Effects {#9-dot-14-second-order-effects}

Every action has a consequence, and those consequences have consequences, which are called Second-Order Effects.


#### WHY {#why}

Changing some aspect of a complex system always introduces Second-Order Effects, some of which may be antithetical to the original intent of the change.


### 9.15 Normal Accidents {#9-dot-15-normal-accidents}

The theory of Normal Accident is a more formal way of expressing a universal proverb: shit happens.
Overreacting to Normal Accidents is actually counterproductive.


#### WHY {#why}

Normal Accidents are a compelling reason to keep the systems you rely on as loose as you possibly can.


#### HOW {#how}

The best way to avoid Normal Accidents is to analyze breakdowns or “close calls” when they happen.

---


## 10. Analyzing Systems {#10-dot-analyzing-systems}

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to Deconstruct systems into smaller parts you can understand, measure what’s important, and discover how parts of the system interact with and depend on one another to function.


### 10.1 Deconstruction {#10-dot-1-deconstruction}

解构


#### WHAT {#what}

Deconstruction is the process of separating complex systems into the smallest possible subsystems in order to understand how things work.
Deconstruction is the reverse-engineering aspect of Gall’s Law.


#### HOW {#how}

In addition, it’s important to understand the conditionals present in a system—if-then or when-then relationships that influence the operation of the system.
Creating diagrams and flowcharts can help you understand how each Inflow, process, trigger, conditional, endpoint, and Outflow comes together.


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

If you know nothing about how cars work...Instead of focusing on how the entire car works, you simply concern yourself with the engine for a while. Where does the subsystem begin? What Flows are involved? What processes take place inside the system? Are there Feedback Loops involved? What happens if Inflows don’t come in? Where does the system end? What are the Outflows?


### 10.2 Measurement {#10-dot-2-measurement}


#### WHAT {#what}

Measurement is the process of collecting data as the system is operating. By collecting information related to the core functions of the system, it’s much easier to understand exactly how well the system itself is performing.


#### WHY {#why}

Measurement helps us avoid [[Absence Blindness](#orgb509006) when analyzing a system.
Measuring something is the first step to improving it.
Peter Drucker famously opined, “What gets measured gets managed.”


### 10.3 Key Performance Indicator {#10-dot-3-key-performance-indicator}


#### WAHT {#waht}

Some Measurements are more important than others: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are Measurements of the critical parts of a System.
Typically, business-related KPIs are directly related to either [The 5 Parts of Every Business or [[Throughput](#org248bcbf)...identify a business’s KPIs:

-   [Value Creation: How quickly is the system creating value? What is the current level of Inflows?
-   [Marketing: How many people are paying Attention to your offer? How many prospects are giving you Permission to provide more information?
-   [Sales: How many prospects are becoming paying customers? What is the average customer’s [Lifetime Value](#org20146ef)?
-   [[Value Delivery](#org8412d0f): How quickly can you serve each customer? What is your current returns or complaints rate?
-   [Finance: What is your [Profit Margin](#orgc33cee1)? How much [Purchasing Power](#org6e7d917) do you have? Are you financially Sufficient?


#### HOW {#how}

Try to limit yourself to only three to five KPIs per system.


### 10.4 Garbage In, Garbage Out {#10-dot-4-garbage-in-garbage-out}


#### WHAT {#what}

Garbage In, Garbage Out is a straightforward principle: put useless input into a System, and you’ll get useless output.


#### HOW {#how}

To improve your results, improve the quality of what you start with.


### 10.5 Tolerance {#10-dot-5-tolerance}

容错


#### WHAT {#what}

A Tolerance is an acceptable level of “normal” error in a system. Within a given range of measurements, the system is performing as intended.
Tolerances are often referred to as being “tight” or “loose.”
A tight Tolerance is one in which there’s little room for error or variability.
A loose Tolerance allows significant room for error or variability and is common when small mistakes produce no major repercussions.
Often, systems companies use this reliability measurement as a Tolerance, and they write a contract called a [Service](#org83d550b) Level Agreement (SLA) that promises to compensate customers if errors exceed a certain threshold.


### 10.6 Analytical Honesty {#10-dot-6-analytical-honesty}


#### WHAT {#what}

Analytical Honesty means measuring and analyzing the data you have dispassionately（客观公正）.


#### HOW {#how}

The best way to maintain Analytical Honesty is to have your measurements evaluated by someone who isn’t personally invested in your system. [Incentive-Caused Bias and [[Confirmation Bias](#org247a4f7) are all too easy to succumb to if your social status is on the line.


### 10.7 Context {#10-dot-7-context}


#### WHAT {#what}

Context is the use of related [Measurements to provide additional information about the data you’re examining.
Aggregate [Measurements almost never tell you anything useful. Aggregate measures are worthless when it comes to making tangible improvements because they lack Context.


#### HOW {#how}

examine no measures in isolation—always look at them in Context with other [Measurements.


### 10.8 Sampling {#10-dot-8-sampling}

样品


#### WHAT {#what}

Sampling is the process of taking at random a small percentage of the total output, then using it as a proxy for the entire system.


#### WHY {#why}

Sampling can help you identify systemic errors quickly without testing all of the output of the system, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
Random “spot checks” are also a form of Sampling.


### 10.9 Margin of Error {#10-dot-9-margin-of-error}


#### WHAT {#what}

Margin of Error is an estimate of how much you can trust your conclusions from a given set of observed Samples.
When it comes to analytical confidence, more data is always better.


### 10.10 Ratio {#10-dot-10-ratio}


#### WHAT {#what}

A Ratio is a method of comparing two Measurements against each other. By dividing your results by your input, you can measure all sorts of useful relationships between different parts of your System.
HERE ARE SOME USEFUL RATIOS TO TRACK:

-   Return on Promotion: For every $1 you spend in advertising, how much revenue do you collect?
-   [Profit](#orgdb40dbb) per Employee: For every person you employ, how much [profit](#orgdb40dbb) does your business generate?
-   Closing Ratio: For every prospect you serve, how many purchase?
-   Returns/Complaints Ratio: For every sale you make, how many choose to return or complain?


### 10.11 Typicality {#10-dot-11-typicality}

典型值


#### WHAT {#what}

Many forms of analysis rely on defining Typicality: identifying a normal or typical value for some important measurement. There are four common methods of calculating a typical value: mean, median, mode, and midrange.

-   A Mean (or average) is calculated by adding the quantities of all data points, then dividing by the total number of data points available.
-   A Median is calculated by sorting the values in order of high to low, then finding the quantity of the data point in the middle of the range.


### 10.12 Correlation and Causation {#10-dot-12-correlation-and-causation}

相关与因果关系


#### WHAT {#what}

That’s Causation: a complete chain of cause and effect.
Correlation is not Causation. Even if you notice that one measurement is highly associated with another, that does not prove that one thing caused the other.
Causation is always more difficult to prove than Correlation. When analyzing complex Systems with many variables and Interdependencies, it’s often extremely difficult to find true causality.


#### HOW {#how}

Adjusting for known variables can help you isolate the potential causes of a change in your system.


### 10.13 Norms {#10-dot-13-norms}

基准


#### WAHT {#waht}

Norms are measures that use historical data as a tool to provide [Context for current [Measurement.


#### WHY {#why}

When Measurement practices Change, Norms based on the previous Measurements are no longer valid.


#### HOW {#how}

Remember, we’re dealing with complex Systems—things always Change over time. Just because something was useful in the past does not mean it will continue to perform as well in perpetuity（永久，永恒）. For best results, reexamine your Norms periodically to make sure they’re valid.


### 10.14 Proxy {#10-dot-14-proxy}


#### WHAT {#what}

A Proxy measures one quantity by measuring something else.


#### HOW {#how}

Useful Proxies are closely related to the primary subject—the closer, the better. Take Web site analytics—you may want to know exactly where and how long people pay Attention to different parts of the Web page, but again, you can’t brain scan each visitor to your Web site.


### 10.15 Segmentation {#10-dot-15-segmentation}


#### WHAT {#what}

Segmentation is a technique that involves splitting a data set into well-defined subgroups to add additional [Context.
There are three common ways to Segment customer data:

-   Past Performance
-   Demographics
-   Psychographics


#### Past Performance {#past-performance}

Segments customers by past known actions.
[Lifetime Value](#org20146ef) calculations are a form of Segmentation by Past Performance.


#### Demographics {#demographics}

Segment customers by external personal characteristics.
Personal information like age, gender, income, nationality, and location can help you determine which customers are your Probable Purchasers.


#### Psychographics {#psychographics}

Segment customers by internal psychological characteristics.
Typically discovered via surveys, assessments, or focus groups, Psychographics are attitudes or worldviews that influence how people see themselves and the world at large.


### 10.16 Humanization {#10-dot-16-humanization}

人性化


#### WHAT {#what}

Humanization is the process of using data to tell a story (Narrative) about a real person’s experience or behavior. Quantifiable measures are helpful in the aggregate, but it’s often necessary to reframe the measure into actual behavior to really understand what’s actually happening.
Many businesses Humanize by developing a series of personas: fictional profiles of people developed from data.

## 11. Improving Systems {#11-dot-improving-systems}

Learn the secrets of Optimization, how to remove unnecessary Friction from critical processes, and how to build Systems that can handle Uncertainty and Change.


### 11.1 [Intervention Bias](#org1b67970) {#11-dot-1-intervention-bias}

<a id="org1b67970">Intervention Bias</a>


#### WHAT {#what}

[Intervention Bias](#org1b67970) makes us likely to introduce changes that aren’t necessary in order to feel in control of a situation.


#### HOW {#how}

The best way to correct for [Intervention Bias](#org1b67970) is to examine what scientists call a “null hypothesis”: examining what would happen if you did nothing or assumed the situation was an accident or error.


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

Imagine a company that allows its employees to purchase any book they want or need, no questions asked...until one employee abuses the privilege and orders hundreds of novels for personal enjoyment. What should be done?...waste time for everyone by increasing paperwork and bureaucracy, and reduce employee productivity by increasing the amount of time it takes to find information they can use to improve the business...The correct response in this case is to do nothing.


### 11.2 Optimization {#11-dot-2-optimization}


#### WHAT {#what}

Optimization is the process of maximizing the output of a System or minimizing a specific input the system requires to operate. Optimization typically revolves around the systems and processes behind your Key Performance Indicator, which measure the critical elements of the system as a whole.
Maximization typically focuses on the system’s [Throughput](#org248bcbf).
Minimization typically focuses on in-process inputs required for the System to operate.
By definition, if you’re trying to Maximize or Minimize more than one thing, you’re not Optimizing—you’re making Trade-offs. Many people use the term Optimization to mean “making everything better,” but that definition doesn’t help you actually do anything.
In practical terms, trying to Optimize for many variables at once doesn’t work—you need to be able to concentrate on a single variable for a while, so you can understand how the Changes you make affect the system as a whole. You’re trying to find Causation (not Correlation) in your Changes, and hidden Interdependencies can make it difficult to understand which Changes produced which results.


### 11.3 Refactoring {#11-dot-3-refactoring}

Refactoring is the process of changing a system to improve efficiency without changing the output of the system.


#### What’s the point? {#what-s-the-point}

The primary benefit of Refactoring isn’t improving the output—it’s making the system itself faster or more efficient.


#### HOW {#how}

Refactoring starts by Deconstructing a process or system, then looking for Patterns.
Once Patterns begin to emerge, you can rearrange the system to group similar processes or inputs together.


#### WHEN {#when}

If your Goal is to make the system faster or more efficient, Refactoring is critically important.


### 11.4 The Critical Few {#11-dot-4-the-critical-few}

关键少数


#### WHAT {#what}

In any complex System, a minority of the inputs produce the majority of the output. This Pattern of persistent nonlinearity is now called the Pareto principle, or the 80-20 rule. Personally, I prefer to refer to it as the Critical Few.


#### EXAMPLES {#examples}

-   In many businesses, less than 20 percent of the customers account for more than 80 percent of annual revenue.
-   Less than 20 percent of a business’s employees typically do 80 percent or more of the highly valuable work.
-   You wear less than 20 percent of the clothing in your closet over 80 percent of the time.
-   You spend over 80 percent of your time communicating with less than 20 percent of your personal contacts.


#### HOW {#how}

For best results, focus on the critical inputs that produce most of the results you want.


### 11.5 [Diminishing Returns](#org88bb41a) {#11-dot-5-diminishing-returns}

  <a id="org88bb41a">Diminishing Returns</a>
边际产量递减 Diminishing Marginal [Product](#org58ac1fe)
All good things are subject to [Diminishing Returns](#org88bb41a)—after a certain point, having more of something can actually be detrimental


#### HOW {#how}

Focus on doing a few simple things that will produce most of the results you’re looking for, then call it a day.
Don’t feel like you have to Optimize absolutely everything to perfection. Optimization as well—a few small changes can produce enormous results.


### 11.6 Friction {#11-dot-6-friction}

摩擦，不合


#### WHAT {#what}

Friction is any force or process that removes energy from a System over time. In the presence of Friction, it’s necessary to continue to add energy to a system to keep it moving at the same rate over time. Unless additional energy is added, Friction will slow the system down until it comes to a stop. Remove the Friction, and you’ll increase the system’s efficiency.
Every business process has some amount of Friction.


#### WHY {#why}

Removing even small amounts of Friction from your Marketing, Sales, and [[Value Delivery](#org8412d0f) processes can generate major improvements in [[Profit](#orgdb40dbb).


#### EXAMPLE {#example}

82 percent of Prime members choose to purchase items on Amazon even when the item is less expensive at a competing retailer.


#### HOW {#how}

Introducing Friction intentionally can sometimes encourage people to behave in a certain way or make a particular decision.


### 11.7 Automation {#11-dot-7-automation}


#### WHAT {#what}

Automation refers to a System or process that can operate without human intervention.
Automation is best for well-defined, repetitive tasks.


#### HOW {#how}

Find a way to Automate your system, and you open the doors to [Scale](#org3dfdeb6) via [Duplication](#orgd63b1b9) and [Multiplication](#org9d381ba), improving your ability to create and deliver value to more paying customers.


### 11.8 The Paradox of Automation {#11-dot-8-the-paradox-of-automation}


#### BACKGROUND {#background}

Consider this: In late 2009, Toyota identified a major issue with the accelerator pedal in several popular vehicle models, which were top sellers for many years. The error was Multiplied across every vehicle Toyota made, and the recall cost over five billion dollars.
Before the recall, Toyota was considered the best automotive manufacturer in the world. They still are in many respects, but their Reputation and financial situation suffered a major blow. Even the best can fall if costly mistakes are allowed to Multiply.


#### WHAT {#what}

Here’s the Paradox of Automation: the more efficient the Automated system, the more crucial the contribution of the human operators of that system. When an error happens, operators need to identify and fix the situation quickly or shut the system down—otherwise, the Automated system will continue to Multiply the error.


### 11.9 The Irony of Automation {#11-dot-9-the-irony-of-automation}


#### WHAT {#what}

Here’s the Irony of Automation: the more reliable the system, the less human operators have to do, so the less they pay Attention to the system while it’s in operation.


#### WHY {#why}

reliable systems tend to dull the operator’s senses, making it very difficult for them to notice when things go wrong—the moment when their attention is most sorely needed.


#### HOW TO AVOID {#how-to-avoid}

The best approach to avoid major Automation errors is rigorous, ongoing [Sampling and Testing.


### 11.10 [Standard Operating Procedure](#org05bf215) {#11-dot-10-standard-operating-procedure}

<a id="org05bf215">Standard Operating Procedure</a>


#### WHAT {#what}

A [Standard Operating Procedure](#org05bf215) (SOP) is a predefined process used to complete a task or resolve a common issue. Business Systems often include repetitive tasks, and having a standard process in place can help you spend less time reinventing the wheel and more time doing productive work.


#### HOW TO USE {#how-to-use}

Don’t let your Standard Operating Procedures lapse into bureaucracy.
For best results, review your SOPs on a periodic basis—once every two to three months is ideal. If you find outdated, wasteful, or unnecessary work in your SOPs, change them. Neither you nor your customers are served by unnecessary red tape.


### 11.11 Checklist {#11-dot-11-checklist}


#### WHAT {#what}

A Checklist is an Externalized, predefined [Standard Operating Procedure](#org05bf215) for completing a specific task.


#### WHY {#why}

for two reasons.
First, Checklisting will help you define a System for a process that hasn’t yet been formalized—once the Checklist has been created, it’s easier to see how to improve or Automate the system.
Second, using Checklists as a normal part of working can help ensure that you don’t forget to handle important steps that are easily overlooked when things get busy.


#### HOW {#how}

For best results, create explicit Checklists for the Five Parts of Your Business, then make sure they’re followed every single time.


### 11.12 Cessation {#11-dot-12-cessation}

停止


#### WHAT {#what}

Cessation is the choice to intentionally（有意的） stop doing something that’s counterproductive（适得其反）. Due to [Absence Blindness](#orgb509006), we’re predisposed to attempt to improve a system by doing something—it “feels wrong” to do nothing.


#### WHAT {#what}

Doing something is not always the best course of action. Consider doing nothing instead.


### 11.13 Resilience {#11-dot-13-resilience}

适应能力
The world is a fundamentally [Uncertaint place. Unexpected things happen.


#### WHAT {#what}

Resilience is a massively underrated quality in business. Having the toughness and flexibility to handle anything life throws at you is a major asset that can save your skin.


#### HOW {#how}

Preparing for the unexpected makes you more Resilient...HERE’S WHAT MAKES A BUSINESS RESILIENT:

-   Low (preferably zero) outstanding debt
-   Low [overhead](#orgfbf3fcf), [fixed costs](#orgabd428f), and operating expenses
-   Substantial cash reserves for unexpected contingencies
-   Multiple independent products/industries/lines of business
-   Flexible workers/employees who can handle many responsibilities well
-   No single points of failure
-   Fail-safes/backup systems for all core processes


### 11.14 Fail-safe {#11-dot-14-fail-safe}

> “Always” and “never” are two words that you should always remember never to use.


#### WHAT {#what}

A Fail-safe is a backup System designed to prevent or allow recovery from a primary system failure.


#### WHY {#why}

Backup systems and Insurance, from one perspective, can be seen as a waste of money—why spend valuable resources on something you hope you’ll never need?


#### HOW {#how}

In order to be effective, Fail-safes must be developed before you need them.
Fail-safes that are highly Interdependent with the primary system can actually introduce additional risks.
As much as possible, never have a single critical point of failure.


### 11.15 Stress Testing {#11-dot-15-stress-testing}

> To make no mistakes is not in the power of man; but from their errors and mistakes the wise and good learn wisdom for the future.

<!--quoteend-->

> —PLUTARCH, ANCIENT GREEK HISTORIAN AND ESSAYIST


#### WHAT {#what}

Stress Testing is the process of identifying the boundaries of a system by simulating specific Environmental conditions.


### 11.16 [Scenario Planning](#org3732725) {#11-dot-16-scenario-planning}

<a id="org3732725">Scenario Planning</a>


#### WHAT {#what}

[Scenario Planning](#org3732725) is the process of systematically constructing a series of hypothetical situations, then [Mentally Simulating what you would do if they occured. You may not be a seer, but Counterfactual Simulation gives you a powerful capability: imagining things that might occur, then figuring out what you’d do if they did. [Scenario Planning](#org3732725) is essentially detailed, thorough, and systematic Counterfactual Simulation applied to major decisions.


#### HOW {#how}

[Scenario Planning](#org3732725) always starts with a simple question: “What would I do if. . . ?” The “what if” part is the Counterfactual, and it’s what kicks your planning brain into gear, helping you imagine possible responses.
Most large businesses use [Scenario Planning](#org3732725) as the basis of a practice called “hedging”: purchasing various forms of Insurance to reduce the Risk of unfavorable future events.


### 11.17 Sustainable Growth Cycle {#11-dot-17-sustainable-growth-cycle}


#### BACKGROUND {#background}

Businesses and biological organisms have many things in common: they’re made up of many interrelated parts and systems that change and grow over time.


#### WHAT {#what}

The Sustainable Growth Cycle is a pattern I’ve noticed in businesses that are able to grow year after year without major difficulties. This cycle has three distinct phases: expansion, maintenance, and consolidation.


#### HOW {#how}

In an Expansion phase, the company is focused on growing.
In a Maintenance phase, the company is focused on executing the current plan.
In a Consolidation phase, the company is focused on analysis.


#### WHY {#why}

A healthy business cycles between expansion, maintenance, and consolidation often. No matter which part of the cycle you’re in, it’s important to recognize that it’s necessary and essential to the health of the business. By giving each cycle the appropriate time and attention, you’ll ensure the long-term success of the business.


### 11.18 The Middle Path {#11-dot-18-the-middle-path}


#### WHAT {#what}


#### WHAT {#what}

The Middle Path is the ever-changing balance point between too little and too much—just enough.


#### HOW {#how}

Try to find the Middle Path, then stay on it as best you can. Find the right balance, and you can accomplish anything.


### 11.19 The Experimental Mindset {#11-dot-19-the-experimental-mindset}

> The only way you learn to flip things is just to flip them!

<!--quoteend-->

> —JULIA CHILD, WORLD-RENOWNED CHEF, AFTER FLOPPING A POTATO PANCAKE ONTO THE FLOOR DURING HER TV SHOW


#### WHY {#why}

Constant Experimentation is the only way you can identify what will actually produce the result you desire.


#### HOW {#how}

You learn the most from what doesn’t go well. As long as your mistakes don’t kill you, paying Attention to what doesn’t work can give you useful information you can use to discover what does.


### 11.20 NOT THE END {#11-dot-20-not-the-end}

B. C. Forbes, the founder of Forbes magazine, who wrote an essay in 1917 called “Keys to Success.”
Your success depends on you.
Your happiness depends on you.
You have to steer your own course.
You have to shape your own fortune.
You have to educate yourself.
You have to do your own thinking.
You have to live with your own conscience.
Your mind is yours and can be used only by you.
You come into this world alone.
You go to the grave alone.
You are alone with your inner thoughts during the journey between.
You make your own decisions.
You must abide by the consequences of your acts…
You alone can regulate your habits and make or unmake your health.
You alone can assimilate things mental and things material…
You have to do your own assimilation all through life.
You can be taught by a teacher, but you have to imbibe the knowledge. He cannot transfuse it into your brain.
You alone can control your mind cells and your brain cells.
You may have spread before you the wisdom of the ages, but unless you assimilate it you derive no benefit from it; no one can force it into your cranium.
You alone can move your own legs.
You alone can move your own arms.
You alone can utilize your own hands.
You alone can control your own muscles.
You must stand on your feet, physically and metaphorically.
You must take your own steps.
Your parents cannot enter into your skin, take control of your mental and physical machinery, and make something of you.
You cannot fight your son’s battles; that he must do for himself.
You have to be captain of your own destiny.
You have to see through your own eyes.
You have to use your own ears.
You have to master your own faculties.
You have to solve your own problems.
You have to form your own ideals.
You have to create your own ideas.
You must choose your own speech.
You must govern your own tongue.
Your real life is your thoughts.
Your thoughts are your own making.
Your character is your own handiwork.
You alone can select the materials that go into it.
You alone can reject what is not fit to go into it.
You are the creator of your own personality.
You can be disgraced by no man’s hand but your own.
You can be elevated and sustained by no man but yourself.
You have to write your own record.
You have to build your own monument—or dig your own pit.
Which are you doing?
