Search intent is often obvious from the wording of the query itself.

## The answer lies in the SERPs {#the-answer-lies-in-the-serps}


## How to optimize for search intent (3 steps) {#how-to-optimize-for-search-intent--3-steps}

Search intent should dictate the type of content you create.
The four search intent groups are way too broad to be actionable.


### Step 1. Check ‘SERP reliability’ {#step-1-dot-check-serp-reliability}


#### Little or no fluctuation in rankings over time {#little-or-no-fluctuation-in-rankings-over-time}


#### Fluctuation of some pages but not others {#fluctuation-of-some-pages-but-not-others}


#### Lots of fluctuation in rankings {#lots-of-fluctuation-in-rankings}

This indicates one of two things:

-   Search intent is constantly changing.
-   Google is struggling to understand the true intent behind the search.


### Step 2. Make sure your content aligns with the “3 C’s of search intent” {#step-2-dot-make-sure-your-content-aligns-with-the-3-c-s-of-search-intent}


### Step 3. Take cues from the search results and top-ranking pages {#step-3-dot-take-cues-from-the-search-results-and-top-ranking-pages}


#### 1) Look at the “People also ask” box in the SERPs {#1-look-at-the-people-also-ask-box-in-the-serps}


#### 2. Run a content gap analysis at the page-level {#2-dot-run-a-content-gap-analysis-at-the-page-level}


#### 3. Visit the top-ranking pages {#3-dot-visit-the-top-ranking-pages}

> Just give people what they want.


## Case study #2: +3,100% more traffic by optimizing for search intent {#case-study-2-plus-3-100-more-traffic-by-optimizing-for-search-intent}

Basically, searchers didn’t want to see a study; they wanted an actionable guide.

So that’s what we created.


## Final thoughts {#final-thoughts}

Search intent is perhaps the most important “[ranking factor](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-ranking-factors/)” in 2019.
