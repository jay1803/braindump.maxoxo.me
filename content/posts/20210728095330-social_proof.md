## DEFINITION {#definition}

****Social proof****, a term coined by Robert Cialdini in his 1984 book
<span class="underline">Influence</span>, is also known as ****informational social influence****. It describes a
psychological and social phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others
in an attempt to undertake behavior in a given situation.

Social proof is considered prominent in ambiguous social situations where
people are unable to determine the appropriate <span class="underline">mode of behavior</span>, and is driven
by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the
current situation.

Social Proof can take on a life of its own. Fads often form when one person
takes an action, others perceive it as a Social Signal [Signalling Theory](signalling-theory.md), then
act the same way, creating a social feedback loop.
