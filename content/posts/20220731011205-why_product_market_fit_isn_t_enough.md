## It’s Not Just Great Product <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#it-s-not-just-great-product}

The “go-to” answer for almost every question in startups, is “build a great product.”

1.  There are great products that never reach $100M+.
2.  There are also terrible products by many people's definition that reach far greater than $100M+. If you’ve ever used Workday, you know what I’m talking about. (At the time of this writing, Workday is worth $20 billion.)

The problem with the answer of “build a great product” is that it leads to something that [Andrew Chen](http://andrewchen.co/) and I talk about extensively in the [Reforge Growth Series](http://reforge.com/growth-series) called the [Product Death Cycle](http://andrewchen.co/this-is-the-product-death-cycle-why-it-happens-and-how-to-break-out-of-it/).  The Product Death Cycle was [originally coined by David Bland](https://twitter.com/davidjbland/status/467096015318036480?lang=en) of [Precoil](http://www.precoil.com/).

In terms of a growth curve, it looks similar to this:

The second “go-to” answer is [Product-Market Fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}).


## It’s Definitely Not Growth Hacking {#it-s-definitely-not-growth-hacking}

Before tactics you need a growth process. But before a growth process you need a strategy. This framework is all about how you construct your strategy and position yourself for "Smooth Sailer" growth.


## What is the difference between Smooth Sailer and Tugboat companies? <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#what-is-the-difference-between-smooth-sailer-and-tugboat-companies}

The difference between the $100M+ companies, and those that struggle are the ones that are able to make four pieces in a puzzle fit:

There are three extremely important points I want to hammer home through out these posts:

1.  You need to find four fits to grow to $100M+ company in a venture-backed time frame.
2.  Each of these fits influence each other, so you can’t think about them in isolation.
3.  The fits are always evolving/changing/breaking. When that happens, you can’t simply change one element, you have to revisit and potentially change them all.
