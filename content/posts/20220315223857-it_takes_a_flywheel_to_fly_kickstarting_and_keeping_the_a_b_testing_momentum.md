## It takes a Flywheel to Fly: Kickstarting and Keeping the A/B testing Momentum {#it-takes-a-flywheel-to-fly-kickstarting-and-keeping-the-a-b-testing-momentum}


### What is a Flywheel? {#what-is-a-flywheel}

The concept of a flywheel was presented in the book “Good to Great”,
illustrating that good-to-great transformations never happen at once but, you
guessed it, in turns. Every flywheel consists of a few carefully derived steps
that logically follow each other in a loop.


### Introducing the A/B testing Flywheel {#introducing-the-a-b-testing-flywheel}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-03-15_22-41-02_ABTestingFlywheel.png" >}}

[A/B Testing Flywheel]({{<relref "20220328174037-a_b_testing_flywheel.md#" >}})
We introduce the steps next, starting with the goal-step of being able to
support more decisions through [A/B Test]({{<relref "20220108110426-a_b_test.md#" >}}).

1.  Running more A/B tests to support more decisions. At the top of the flywheel
    is the goal – using A/B tests to support decision making. With every turn of
    the flywheel, we aim to run more A/B tests to support more decisions.
2.  Measure value to decision making. While not every A/B test has substantial
    impact on decisions, some A/B tests do, and the impact and value added by A/B
    tests need to be measured and captured. The more A/B tests we run with each
    turn of the flywheel, the more aggregate value and impact the A/B testing
    program will provide.
3.  Increasing interest in A/B testing. When A/B testing is ran by one team and
    those results are shared broadly, this can lead to interest in A/B testing by
    new teams and new A/B testing scenarios. To support this spread of interest,
    the value of A/B tests needs to be broadly communicated. Additionally,
    educational and support efforts are needed to support new teams interested in
    using A/B testing to ensure their initial experience with A/B testing is a
    success.
4.  Investing in A/B testing infrastructure and data quality. The more interest
    and willingness there is to try A/B testing within an organization, the more
    resources can be justifiably allocated to make an A/B testing program
    successful. These resources should be directed towards two key areas:
    improving A/B testing capabilities for managing and analyzing A/B tests, and
    increasing data quality. The goal of these investments is to make A/B tests
    are more trustworthy and easier to execute.
5.  Lowering human cost of A/B testing. Improvements in A/B testing
    infrastructure and data quality create conditions for streamlining the A/B
    testing process and lowering its human cost i.e., the amount of investment
    required to start doing A/B testing in a new area. Lowering the cost of A/B
    testing is a critical step in the flywheel that is often missed. If running
    A/B tests remains costly, A/B testing will remain limited to highly
    interested early adopters with a lot of resources. This step increases the
    return on investment (ROI) of A/B testing by reducing the “I” and making it
    worthwhile for more teams who may be less convinced about the “R” or are more
    resource constrained, to try running A/B tests.


### The first turn {#the-first-turn}

1.  Running the first A/B test. often starts with a single team trying out A/B
    testing in one specific scenario, such as the signup flow on a website...In
    this initial stage, A/B tests need to be chosen wisely...Note that it is
    important to differentiate between the success of an A/B test and the success
    of an idea being tested.
    -   High value potential. features that have potential for high impact and relate to team goals.
    -   Simple to execute. initial A/B tests should be as simple to configure and execute as possible.
    -   Easy to measure. Ideally, the product should already be instrumented, and
        data pipelines for metric computation should already exist.
2.  Measuring value.
3.  Increasing Interest. If the A/B test was planned and executed correctly it
    will certainly result in learnings that will be of interest to many in the
    company.
4.  Investing in Infrastructure. should focus on trustworthiness, especially in the early steps.
5.  Lowering the cost. start automating the fundamental data quality checks such
    as the Sample Ratio Mismatch [7] and make it easy to start an A/A test to
    validate new set-ups and new metrics


### Making the A/B testing Flywheel Spin {#making-the-a-b-testing-flywheel-spin}

1.  Running more A/B tests.
2.  Measuring more value.
3.  Increasing Interest even more.
4.  Investing in Infrastructure.
5.  Lowering the cost of A/B testing even more.
