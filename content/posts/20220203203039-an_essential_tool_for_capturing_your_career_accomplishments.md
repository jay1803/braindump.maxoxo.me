## An Essential Tool for Capturing Your Career Accomplishments {#an-essential-tool-for-capturing-your-career-accomplishments}

Imagine you’re ready to apply for your next job...you probably haven’t updated
your résumé or your portfolio... and you can’t remember what work you’ve done
over the past few years...This is a stressful and ineffective way to approach a
job search.


### The Career Management Document {#the-career-management-document}

<<< Career Management Document>>> [CMD]({{<relref "20220203203255-career_management_document.md#" >}})
A Career Management Document (CMD) is a comprehensive collection of your résumé
and portfolio content. It’s a document you update regularly, over time, with all
the work you’ve done.

I update my CMD about once a week. I start by reviewing evidence of my recent
work.

Here are some examples from my CMD:

-   Coached a student on writing a stronger portfolio story to showcase their advanced UX skills, resulting in the student getting a job interview.
-   Facilitated an end-of-study analysis in under 90 minutes to help the team synthesize user research data from 12 participants.
-   Led a remote retrospective with teams in two offices, developed actionable takeaways, and ended on time despite a delayed start.


### Include portfolio artifacts with your CMD {#include-portfolio-artifacts-with-your-cmd}

I capture content for my portfolio. Each week, I gather screenshots of my work,
photos of me working with the team, and any other artifacts I can find.


### Update your CMD regularly {#update-your-cmd-regularly}

I schedule thirty minutes on my calendar each week so I remember to do it.


### The CMD benefits you in additional ways {#the-cmd-benefits-you-in-additional-ways}

The [CMD]({{<relref "20220203203255-career_management_document.md#" >}}) can help you prepare for your job search beyond your résumé and your
portfolio.
