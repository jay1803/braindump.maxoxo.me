## Utilitarianism {#utilitarianism}

是一种伦理学之理论类型，认为最正确的行为是将效益达到最大。“效益”就是快乐，倾向
得到最大快乐，而倾向避免痛苦就是正确。功利主义的创始人边沁将效用描述为一个行为
所产生的所有快感的总和，减去参与此行为的所有人的痛苦。功利主义是一种结果主义，
结果主义认为任何行为的结果是评判对错的唯一标准。与其他形式的结果主义（如伦理利
己主义）不同的是，功利主义平等地考虑所有受牵连的人的利益，乃至有些更顾及动物之
利益。

Utilitarianism is a family of normative ethical theories that prescribe
actions that maximize happiness and well-being for all affected
individuals. Although different varieties of utilitarianism admit
different characterizations, the basic idea behind all of them is to in some
sense maximize utility, which is often defined in terms of well-being or
related concepts.

Utilitarianism is a version of [Consequentialism]({{<relref "20210206092506-consequentialism.md#" >}}), which states that the
consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong. Unlike
other forms of consequentialism, such as egoism and altruism, utilitarianism
considers the interests of all humans equally.
