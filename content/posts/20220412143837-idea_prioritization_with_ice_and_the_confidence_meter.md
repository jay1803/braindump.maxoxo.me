-  Which product idea would you choose?


### Prioritizing Using ICE Score {#prioritizing-using-ice-score}

-   Impact is an estimate of how much the idea will positively affect the key metric you’re trying to improve.
-   Ease (of implementation) is an estimation of how much effort and resources will be required to implement this idea. This is typically the inverse of effort (person-week) — lower effort means higher ease.
-   Confidence indicates how sure we are about Impact, and to some degree also about ease of implementation. I’ve written a whole [article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/@itamargilad/why-impact-effort-prioritization-doesnt-work-57d141fafc2c&sa=D&ust=1523959361789000) to explain why prioritization by impact and effort is not enough.
