## NOTES {#notes}

In order to solve for value and viability, the competent [Product Manager](20210721230441-product_manager.md) must
skilled in the following four critical areas:

1.  Deep Knowledge of the Users and Customers
    Without this deep customer knowledge, the product manager is just guessing.
2.  Deep Knowledge of the Data
    1.  be expert on how the product is being used
    2.  and sales
    3.  and changing over time.
3.  Deep Knowledge of the Business
    understanding your go-to-market strategy, the needs of your various
      stakeholders
    your business model
    the dynamics of the ecosystem you operate in;
    and certainly the economics of your product.
4.  Deep Knowledge of the Industry
    1.  not only includes competitors, but also key trends in terms of
        technology, customer behaviors and expectations.

In certain companies, there is so much in terms of domain knowledge, the
[Product Manager](20210721230441-product_manager.md) may be supplemented with what are called “domain experts” or
“subject matter experts.”  Examples of this would be companies building tax
software, or creating things like medical devices.
