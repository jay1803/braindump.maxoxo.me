## Leveraging Search Intent To Dominate the SERPs {#leveraging-search-intent-to-dominate-the-serps}


### What Is Search Intent? <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#what-is-search-intent}

[Search Intent]({{< relref "20221025135145-search_intent.md" >}}) is the reason why a person searches for a specific query.

For example, [Canva uses different landing pages](https://foundationinc.co/lab/canva-seo) in response to different search intents for similar queries.
