The process is fairly straight forwards and consists of the following steps:

1.  Order is received
2.  Order request is registered in the inventory system
3.  An order confirmation is sent to the customer
4.  Order request is sent to the warehouse
5.  A warehouse worker locates and picks the ordered item
6.  Order is packed and prepared for shipping
7.  Order is shipped
8.  The customer is notified that the order is on its way
9.  Order is delivered
10. If necessary, order returns are handled and refunds granted
11. Inventory is updated
