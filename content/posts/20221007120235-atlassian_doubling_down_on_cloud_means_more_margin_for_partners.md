[Atlassian]({{< relref "20220711171528-atlassian.md" >}}) annual growth rate of 9% between 2018 and 2025.

“We shared in a recent investor newsletter that 50 percent moved from self-hosted to cloud in the last year,” said Martin Musierowicz, head of global channels for Atlassian. “To make that seamless, we have new tools and programs.”

Atlassian soon will allow customers to choose where in its global data center footprint they want to store their content.

To that point, Atlassian has raised margins by 10% for partners selling new cloud business. On top of that, it is paying a migration bonus of another 15%. All in all, partners can make 50% margin total – based on the existing margin of 25% and the new, extra 25% – for migrating on-premises users to cloud.
