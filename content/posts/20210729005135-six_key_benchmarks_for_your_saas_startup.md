### Cost of Customer Acquisition is About 11 Months' of Revenue. {#cost-of-customer-acquisition-is-about-11-months-of-revenue-dot}

The median startup spends about 92% of first year average contract value on
the sale, implying an 11 month payback period on the CAC.

The top 50% of growers generate more upsell business than their slower
growing competitors.


### Sales commission as % of ACV 9% {#sales-commission-as-of-acv-9}

I assumed the typical ACV/compensation ratio was about 4:1 but in practice
that number is closer to 10:1.


### Median Monthly Revenue Churn is 0.75% {#median-monthly-revenue-churn-is-0-dot-75}

This means each year, the median business loses about 10% of its revenue to
churning customers.
