## NOTES {#notes}

a product should have — value and complexity.

Product value is the benefit that a customer gets by using a product to
satisfy her needs minus associated costs.

Complexity is the effort associated with delivering such a product to the customer.


### Absolute vs. relative value {#absolute-vs-dot-relative-value}

Absolute value quantifies how well a product meets customers needs whereas
relative value puts the product value in the perspective of the available
solution alternatives.


### Ideal, diminishing and declining value {#ideal-diminishing-and-declining-value}

Typically a product has a few key features that deliver that vast majority of
the aggregate value.


### Real vs. perceived value {#real-vs-dot-perceived-value}

release value: total value that a product objectively offers to a customer, or the total
value a customer could reap if using all functionality optimally.

Perceived value: On the other hand, if you over-promise and under-deliver the
customers will find out and will be disappointed.


### Value of a habit {#value-of-a-habit}

it is true that if a prospective customer is deciding between two options,
she will choose the one that will offer more perceived value.

A study by John T .Gourville, a professor at Harvard Business School, states
that the difference in value between a new product and existing product must
be up to 900% for users to adopt the new product.

It turns out that the total value of a product can actually increase over
time even if the functionality does not change. How? The users settle into
strong habitual behavior surrounding a product — a habit or a routine that
they conduct repeatedly with minimal cognitive effort.

During the habit forming phase, the association between her need to achieve a
goal (trigger) and her action to use product B intensifies. The cognitive effort
during the process decreases and the total value she reaps from the product thus
increases.
