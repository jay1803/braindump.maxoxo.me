## The absurdity of being too busy {#the-absurdity-of-being-too-busy}

Both himself and his team were too busy to do their work properly and with any level of quality that wouldn't only make matters worse.
In this case, the only reasonable ways for the business to exert influence over the work, are to:

1.  Decrease the scope of work.
2.  Fund additional teams and/or restructure the work accordingly.
3.  Move the delivery date.


## You should only ever be busy on purpose {#you-should-only-ever-be-busy-on-purpose}

If you are too busy, why? What are you and your team in pursuit of? If you are too busy because of pressure imposed by someone else, why do they believe they should be able to ask more of you?
