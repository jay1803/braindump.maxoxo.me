## DEFINITION {#definition}

Uncertainty refers to epistemic situations involving imperfect or unknown
information. It applies to predictions of future events, to physical
measurements that are already made, or to the unknown. Uncertainty arises in
partially observable or stochastic environments, as well as due to ignorance,
indolence, or both.
