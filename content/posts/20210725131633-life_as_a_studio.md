## NOTES {#notes}

By a studio, I mean a space for creative work that has grown and accreted the
right tools in the right places over time.

But the most interesting parts of someone’s workspace are always the things
they didn’t intentionally arrange from the start.

They are the result of a hundred little micro-decisions we make on a daily
basis.
