-   [TTV]({{< relref "20220227223812-time_to_value.md" >}}): TTV is the time it takes new users to reach their activation moment. The faster you get users to activation, the more likely it’ll be that they stick around.
-   [Activation Rate]({{< relref "20210906161249-activation.md#activation-rate" >}}): When the user has experienced meaningful value in the product. (Sometimes referred to as the “Aha!” moment).
-   [PQL]({{< relref "20210924095503-product_qualified_lead.md" >}}): A product qualified lead (PQL) is a lead that has experienced meaningful value using your product through a free trial or freemium model. These users are the best positioned for an upsell.
