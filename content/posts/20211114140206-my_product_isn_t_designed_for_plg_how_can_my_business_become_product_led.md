## My Product Isn’t Designed for PLG: How Can My Business Become Product-Led? {#my-product-isn-t-designed-for-plg-how-can-my-business-become-product-led}

product-led growth isn’t about offering customers a free trial of your product.


### 3 Ways To Incorporate Product-Led Growth Tactics Without a Trial/Freemium Option {#3-ways-to-incorporate-product-led-growth-tactics-without-a-trial-freemium-option}

Additionally, access to product and pricing information early in the customer
journey is increasingly becoming a requisite.


#### 1. Company-wide centricity around the product {#1-dot-company-wide-centricity-around-the-product}

-   Empower all teams to share and track product & customer feedback
-   Offer company-wide product training
-   Ensure customer-facing teams are product-certified
-   Provide a public-facing roadmap

We’ve seen companies take two main approaches:

1.  Granular Feature Requests – Allow customers to view and prioritize feature
    requests.
2.  Guiding Product Priorities – Provide a set of foundational principles that
    guide upcoming product development.


#### 2. Offer transparent, upfront pricing {#2-dot-offer-transparent-upfront-pricing}

Sales Teams:
Share a list of commonly asked questions around pricing so marketing can build an FAQs section into the pricing page
Set up appropriate lead routing based on plan type and company size.

Marketing
Develop marketing copy on the pricing page that reinforces the value your product provides to customers. Many teams also include logos and customer quotes to provide further validation.
Setup conversion tracking (through Google Analytics or a product analytics tool) so you can quantitatively assess the impact of the pricing page rollout


#### 3. Decouple product access from the demo {#3-dot-decouple-product-access-from-the-demo}
