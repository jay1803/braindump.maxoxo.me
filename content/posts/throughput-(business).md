****Throughput**** is rate at which a product is moved through a production process and is consumed by the end-user, usually measured in the form of sales or use statistics. The goal of most organizations is to minimize the investment in inputs as well as operating expenses while increasing throughput of its production systems. Successful organizations which seek to gain market share strive to match throughput to the rate of market demand of its products.
Using  [Little's Law](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s%5FLaw>) , one can calculate throughput with the equation:
\`I = R Ã— T\`
where:


## ****I**** is the number of units contained within the system, inventory; {#i-is-the-number-of-units-contained-within-the-system-inventory}


## ****T**** is the time it takes for all the inventory to go through the process, flow time; {#t-is-the-time-it-takes-for-all-the-inventory-to-go-through-the-process-flow-time}


## ****R**** is the rate at which the process is delivering throughput, flow rate or throughput. {#r-is-the-rate-at-which-the-process-is-delivering-throughput-flow-rate-or-throughput-dot}
