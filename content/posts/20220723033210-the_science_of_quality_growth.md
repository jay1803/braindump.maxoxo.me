[Business Growth]({{< relref "20220301131342-business_growth.md" >}}) is not about moving metrics using anecdotes and short-term tactics. A healthy and sustainable growth plan should go hand-in-hand with great products that ensure members continue to receive increasing value.


## Measuring success {#measuring-success}

For [Linkedin]({{< relref "20211230140014-linkedin.md" >}}) product, we have one primary success metric, which we call our “true-north metric.” ( [NSM]({{< relref "20211029125148-north_star_metric.md" >}}) )

For a true-north metric like long-term engagement, we might relate it back to a desired outcome, such as “active members after six months.”


## Design your true-north metric {#design-your-true-north-metric}

At LinkedIn, we’ve invented a true-north metric called Quality Signup.
Quality Signup tracks the number of new members who have taken steps to establish their identity and grow their network within their first week as a member.

For example, [Facebook]({{< relref "20211230140824-facebook.md" >}}) is known to track users who connect with 10 friends in seven days. [Pinterest]({{< relref "20211105130702-pinterest.md" >}}) tracks Weekly Active Repinners. And [Slack]({{< relref "20211230134357-slack.md" >}}) tracks teams who have sent 2,000 messages.
