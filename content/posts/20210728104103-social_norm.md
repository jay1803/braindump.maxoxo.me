## DEFINITION {#definition}

Social norms are shared expectations of acceptable behavior by groups.


### Function {#function}

Social norms can both be informal understandings that govern the behavior of
members of a society, as well as be codified into rules and laws.[3]
Institutions are composed of multiple norms.[4] Norms are shared and social
beliefs about behavior; thus, they are distinct from "ideas", "attitudes",
and "values", which can be held privately, and which do not necessarily
concern behavior.[2] Norms are contingent on context, social group, and
historical circumstances.[5]
