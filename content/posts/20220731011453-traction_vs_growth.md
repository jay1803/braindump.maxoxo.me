## Traction {#traction}

-   Goal: The one and only goal should be to find product-market fit among some audience segment.
-   Metric: Plain and simple your eye should be on retention.


## Transition {#transition}


### Goal {#goal}

The primary goal in the traction phase is to identify, define, and understand the growth levers for your business.   For example, if your success metric is DAU’s, you need to uncover the variables in your product and marketing that lead to an increase in DAU’s.


### Metric {#metric}

The primary metric to start tracking is growth rate on either a weekly or monthly basis.


### Volume {#volume}


### Channels {#channels}

Now is not the time to diversify.  Now is the time to focus.  Identify the one channel that has the most ceiling room and double down.  Multiple channels creates overhead.  You want to minimize that overhead as you build out your growth team and process.

The goal right now is **growth rate**. The fastest way to increase growth rate is to expand on something that is already working


### Optimization {#optimization}

During the transition phase there are typically large macro optimizations that still need to be done.


### Team {#team}

During the transition phase you should start to build out a dedicated growth team.


## Growth {#growth}

作者把增长分为 3 个阶段：

1.  Traction
2.  Transition
3.  Growth

第一个阶段要解决的问题是 [PMF]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}})
实际上和 [Cold Start Theory]({{< relref "20211211012938-cold_start_theory.md" >}}) 中的五个阶段的前三个是一样的。
