## Overview {#overview}

Yesterday I was fortunate enough to get to spend about three hours with [Clayton Christensen]({{< relref "20221105134520-clayton_christensen.md" >}}).


## One thing he said {#one-thing-he-said}

You’ve probably heard it said that someone can’t be taught until they’re ready to learn.

Clay explained it in a way that I’ve never heard before and I’ll never forget again. Paraphrased slightly, he said: “Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You have to ask the question – you have to want to know – in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.”
