## Definition {#definition}

It is a unit of progress process and describes learnings generated by trying
out an initial idea and then measuring it against potential customers to
validate the effect. Each test of an idea is a single iteration in a larger
process of many iterations whereby something is learnt and then applied to
succeeding tests.[2] The term coined in the lean startup scene, but it can be
applied universally.


## Usage {#usage}

Is used in [Scrum]({{<relref "20210815112334-scrum.md#" >}}), Proposed by [Eric Ries]({{<relref "20210815112419-eric_ries.md#" >}})


## Progress {#progress}

Typical steps in validated learning:

1.  Specify a goal
2.  Specify a metric that represents the goal
3.  Act to achieve the goal
4.  Analyze the metric â€“ did you get closer to the goal?
5.  Improve and try again
