I can tell you the origin story of the concept. I learned it from Sequoia Capital. [Don Valentine]({{< relref "20221206130506-donald_thomas_valentine.md" >}}) really invented it.

Don used to say, "I'm looking to invest in companies that can screw everything up and still succeed because the customer pulls the product out of their hands."

I actually defined it in terms used by Steve Blank and Eric Ries.
They were the first to apply the scientific method to business and I think that Steve's great contribution to the entrepreneurship business was the idea that first you have to prove a value hypothesis and only once you've proven the value hypothesis should you test a [growth hypothesis]({{< relref "20210815111852-growth_hypothesis.md" >}}). To me, product-market fit is when you have proven the value hypothesis.

-   How do I know when I have it?
-   I have four heuristics that I use, two for consumer and two for enterprise.
    the two best consumer ones that I know are exponential organic growth.
    the best test of word of mouth is exponential organic growth because the only way you can get exponential organic growth is through word of mouth.
    The other heuristic that I suggest is net promoter score, which is a proxy for word of mouth. It's not quite as good and there are outliers where it just doesn't work.
    On the enterprise side, the two that I suggest are one that I learned from one of my teaching partners at Stanford, [Mark Lesli]({{< relref "20221206131359-mark_lesli.md" >}})e, who created something called the sales learning curve. Not one of the the metrics that Mark used to determine where in a company's sales life it was was by measuring the [sales yield](#org-radio--sales-yield). The <span class="org-radio" id="org-radio--sales-yield">sales yield</span> is the contribution margin of a sales team divided by the total cost to field the sales team.
    So if you have a direct sales rep, an SE, an inside sales rep and management overhead, a sales team might cost on the order of five or $600,000. What Mark in Chuck Holloway, his coauthor of the paper that they published in Harvard Business Review found was that when a company gets to a [sales yield](#org-radio--sales-yield) greater than one, that's how you know you've hit [product-market fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}).

    companies typically require that they be limited to 30 days and that the customer signs a contract that says if the product does what you represent, I will buy it after 30 days.
    what Doug suggests is at the end of 30 days, you pull the trial, no matter what. If the customer doesn't scream, you don't have product-market fit because if they're not going to buy it at the end of the 30 days, they're not desperate.

you want to go find people who actually love what you're doing, not try to convince the no's and turn them into yeses.

If the venture capitalist doesn't immediately say, "When can I meet you again?" You haven't found [product-market fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}).

There's a book that I've heard you reference recently...[Crossing the Chasm]({{< relref "20210812231003-crossing_the_chasm.md" >}})
Crossing the Chasm is there is a natural rate of adoption of every product. That hasn't changed. It was true a hundred years ago and it's going to be true in another 100 years.

The basic premise is that there are different people who are willing to adopt at different rates. By the way, those people change over time.
the first people who adopt products are the [early adopters]({{< relref "20220109230444-technology_adoption_lifecycle.md#earlyadopter" >}}).

Next come the [pragmatists]({{< relref "20220109230444-technology_adoption_lifecycle.md#earlymajority" >}}). The pragmatists, they want something that's evolutionary, not revolutionary.
The biggest problem by far, the biggest mistake I see people make is trying to start with the pragmatists because it's the biggest market

[Facebook]({{< relref "20211230140824-facebook.md" >}}) is a perfect example of the Crossing the Chasm philosophy. So they solved a very, very small problem, which is, there was no common Facebook across the freshman class at Harvard.

I often get asked, "Well, if your product is so great, why doesn't everyone use it?" Because it takes a while for you to transition from early adopters to the early majority to late majority and the laggards.

it feels like that was an example where [Mark Zuckerberg]({{< relref "20221206144612-mark_zuckerberg.md" >}}) didn't say, "I wonder what the market for social networking is going to be." I think he was solving his own problem.

[Google]({{< relref "20220129140242-google.md" >}}). So we all know about how it took off as a search engine, but as a business, it exactly followed the Crossing the Chasm philosophy or the technology adoption life cycle.
When they first started monetizing, they used text ads. Now at the time, [Yahoo]({{< relref "20221206144830-yahoo.md" >}}) offered display ads. Yahoo sold these ads through a sales force. In order to justify the cost of a sales call, you had to sign up to a minimum of $10,000 a month contract for six or 12 months to justify the cost of the sales call.
Startups who couldn't afford it. So they went to the desperate and you could get buy an ad for as little as $1 on your credit card with a self-service process.

story of [Netflix]({{< relref "20220316163546-netflix.md" >}})...[Reed Hastings]({{< relref "20220316163955-reed_hastings.md" >}}) was the seed investor. He wasn't the founder of the company and he was the chairman of the company. One of the big mistakes we talked about was how people iterate on the what, they shouldn't, but you should iterate on the who and the how, the business model.

One of the things that Reed did to turn Pure into a very successful, I think greater than $100 million revenue technical software company which was very unusual at that time, was he changed the business model from perpetual license to subscription license.

let me offer a framework for thinking about this that I learned from my investment idol, a man named [Howard Marks]({{< relref "20221206155315-howard_marks.md" >}}) who is the founder of a distress debt investment firm called [Oaktree Capital]({{< relref "20221206155350-oaktree_capital.md" >}}). He believes that investing and I believe entrepreneurship can be described with a two by two matrix. On one dimension, you can be right or wrong and on the other dimension you can be consensus or non-consensus. Obviously if you're wrong, you don't make money, but what most people don't realize is if you're right in consensus, you don't make money because the returns get arbitraged away.

Now, if you ask five people on the street about your idea, which might be a killer idea, at least four out of the five of them should say they don't like it because they haven't been conditioned to like it.

Human beings are conditioned to like things or not like things.

If everyone likes the idea, it means they've already been conditioned. You're trying to do a better job of what somebody else has. That is not a recipe for success in technology.

You talked earlier about [Scott Cook]({{< relref "20221206161020-scott_cook.md" >}}) and being the best product guy you knew.

One of the amazing lessons that I learned from him was a concept that is a core part of the [Intuit]({{< relref "20221206161321-intuit.md" >}}) culture now, which is to savor surprises.
they mean that whenever you create a new product and bring it to market, either as a minimum viable product to a group of five users or to a thousand users, there's always going to be a surprise. Something you didn't expect people to react to positively or negatively. Scott found that all of the value lies in the surprise.

when he's in a meeting and somebody's proposing a big project or a launch or a new initiative, he would ask, "Well as you did this analysis at work, what surprised you?" What he learned was that if the people couldn't answer that question, they were really just trying to get their agenda across.
how could you possibly have a market discovery or customer discovery exercise where nothing surprised you? How could that ever make sense?

our president at Wealthfront has a great saying that the definition of a good experiment is one from which you learned, not one that succeeded.

eBay, we had a ton of them. What I had learned from this experience was that it's hard to catalyze a marketplace so you tend to focus on the sell side before the buy side.

I was reading a chapter of a [Clay Christensen]({{< relref "20221105134520-clayton_christensen.md" >}}) book
It was better, but better doesn't matter.

What we know about engineers is they hate being sold. They're like cats. They're not like dogs. Salespeople are like dogs. They want to be petted and loved. Engineers do not want to be sold to.
That was the surprise. So we went all education and immediately Facebook and LinkedIn people signed up and then used their networks to start telling their friends.
Then we moved into adjacent markets, we got product managers, we got business development people, we got salespeople at the internet companies, and then they went to school with people in other professions.
