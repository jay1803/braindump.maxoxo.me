[Olivia Nottebohm]({{< relref "20220918195636-olivia_nottebohm.md" >}}), CRO of [Notion]({{< relref "20220916105516-notion.md" >}})

back in 2014, I co-wrote an article called Grow Fast or Die Slow.

We found growth is super hard to maintain.

You sold to a set of decision-makers. They made a decision about the SaaS software. They pushed it down and people at the company used it. This was not a bad model. By the way, this is how [SAP]({{< relref "20220918200451-sap.md" >}}) and [Salesforce]({{< relref "20210704214558-salesforce.md" >}}) made it all the way up and over to the $5 billion mark.

But then in about 2010, we saw a shift. This was more about the usability of the product.
Slack is a perfect example of this. And interestingly, executives listen. They listened and made decisions based on what people were telling them.

the third wave is led and driven by community.
People have even more agency than they did in 2010 to decide what is it that they want to use at work
influencers in social media..The third are review sites.

There’s all that posts that you want to put up, the blogs you want to make so that SEO takes hold and really takes off. There are events you want to do, there’s paid media you want to do.
But at the end of the day, you feel like you’re running out of time and you’re running out of budget.

And she quickly hired someone named Ben Lang who at the time was running a Notion fan site that was getting 80,000 hits per month, all about Notion.

> 最关键的问题实际上是有人已经愿意帮助产品创建社区了。因为产品足够出色，让用户愿意将自己的心得分享给其他人。

Ivan, our co-founder and CEO and Akshay, our COO, were on their way to Singapore and decided, “Hey, why don’t we reach out and tell people that we’re going to be there, that we want to hear from them?”
today there are about 145,000 in our Subreddit.
that is now 34,000 people in our Korea Facebook group.
how do you make sure they get value out of the product quickly?

You need to encourage your community members to actually make those videos where they’re creating the education on your behalf.

Marie Poulin. And she is someone who, when we met, she only had 100 Twitter follow today. She has 22,000 Twitter followers, and she’s able to sell out classes on how to use Notion. Truly a gift back to the community, but also terrific to see that she’s able to monetize this and actually, this is what she does for a living.

August Bradley. He had six followers on YouTube when we first met him. He now has 42,000 followers on YouTube and he just sold out a masterclass on Notion and has so far made $200,000 just on that two week course.

What we decided to do was actually put templates on our website so that users could quickly get into the flow of the product and immediately understand how they could use it, how they could find the usability quickly and how that product was going to work for them.
And what really formed was a marketplace.

In fact, there’s one that Janel Loi created, the Newsletter OS. And so far, she’s put it down there and just recently, I found that she has made $34,000 on this template alone.

but now the question is, how do I get more users in that same company or in that same team?
Usually they have thousands of salespeople, they have thousands of customer success folks. I was at Google Cloud, we definitely had thousands of them.

we actually pulled together the group of people that had organically raised up and decided to build businesses on Notion. They’ve decided to be Notion consultants.

this has just been a wonderful extension of our customer success team. And in fact, we still use our customer success team, but we really keep it quite small and we’ve been using it only for enterprise customers.

finding value out of the use case is really all that matters in a product led company.

We found that typically there were one or two people in these teams and in these companies that just deeply loved the product, really, really knew the product and could be our voice into these bigger and broader teams.

they’ve actually created a community of champions. So champions from different companies who are all on Notion come together and they exchange ideas and they exchange best practices.

All of these that really make them feel like they can truly represent Notion within their companies themselves.

leaders like Michael Manapat, who’s our head of engineering, like Ivan, like Simon, like Akshay and able to ask questions directly of them about what are they thinking about the product?

there are three stages of the funnel and each of them is conducive to community-led growth. In the first stage, you can leverage the community to drive awareness.

if you are focused more on B2C and SMB, and you’re early in that product phase, truly leverage the focus groups and help them understand what you’re trying to accomplish and then listen, and take that input.

be grateful to the community. It’s really amazing when people spend the time to get deep into the product, to fall in love with the product and then decide to turn out to the world and tell your story for you.
