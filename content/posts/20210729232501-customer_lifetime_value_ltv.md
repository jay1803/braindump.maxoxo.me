### What is customer lifetime value? {#what-is-customer-lifetime-value}

[Customer Lifetime Value](customer-lifetime-value.md) is the predicted economic value of a customer
over the course of their relationship with a brand.


#### How to calculate lifetime value {#how-to-calculate-lifetime-value}

LTV = ((ASP X Gross Margin) x Net Retention % / Purchase Frequency) x Tenure

-   [ASP](20210729003340-average_sale_price.md): Average sales price or spend per customer. Divide total annual
    revenue by the number of purchases during the same time period.
-   [Gross Margin](20210729011241-gross_margin.md): The ratio of total revenue per customer to the cost of goods
    sold. To calculate, subtract the cost of goods sold throughout the year
    from the annual revenue, then divide by annual revenue.
-   Net retention percentage or purchase frequency: Average expansion rate or
    purchase frequency per customer. For SaaS, net retention percentage
    captures the amount of revenue change within the install base. For
    consumer or goods business models, purchase frequency will work, just
    divide the number of purchases by the number of unique customers who made
    purchases during the time period.
-   Tenure: The average amount of time a customer continues to purchase.
