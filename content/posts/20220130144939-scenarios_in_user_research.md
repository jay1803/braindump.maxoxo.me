## Scenarios in User Research {#scenarios-in-user-research}

[Scenario]({{<relref "20220130132918-scenario.md#" >}})s are descriptive or pictorial stories of the users or personas we are
designing for. Scenarios involve a user performing certain actions or
simulations to accomplish a goal. It also involves using a product, service or
prototype to accomplish certain goals in their day-to-day activities or
otherwise.
