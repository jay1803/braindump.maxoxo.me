## Definition {#definition}

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is designed to tell you how much you need to
spend to acquire a single new customer.

For most B2B SaaS businesses, the costs of acquiring a new customer are
determined by two factors:

-   The costs of generating a lead (usually determined by marketing expenses).
-   The costs of converting that lead into a customer (normally a result of
    sales costs, or touch costs - the salaries of sales development reps or
    field sales people).


### Formula {#formula}

CAC = total cost of Sales & Marketing / Number of Deals closed.
