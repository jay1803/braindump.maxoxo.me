## DEFINITION {#definition}

Modal Bias is the automatic assumption that our idea or approach is best. Most
of us like to assume we have everything together—that we know what we’re
talking about, we know what we’re doing, and that our way of doing things is
best. Very often, we are quite mistaken.


## HOW TO AVOID {#how-to-avoid}

The best way to avoid Modal Bias is to use Inhibition（拟制）to temporarily suspend judgment.
Part of the value of understanding cognitive biases is the knowledge that
you’re not immune to them, and simply knowing they exist doesn’t make them any
less influential.
