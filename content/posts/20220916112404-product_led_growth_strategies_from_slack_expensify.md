[Slack]({{< relref "20211230134357-slack.md" >}}), Expensify and UberConference – what do they have in common? All three companies are deploying a robust product led growth ([PLG]({{< relref "20220707205151-product_led_growth.md" >}})) strategy

Product led growth is a go-to-market strategy that relies on product features &amp; usage as the primary drivers of customer acquisition, retention and expansion.

Slack as the paragon for PLG, I was excited to talk to their Head of Product Marketing, Kelly Watkins

“It starts with the product first and the product experience first and by the nature of that product experience itself having substance and providing value to people, that is where the benefit comes in of it selling itself, or of it being the mechanism that propels the success forward with other aspects of the company assisting in that.”

Slack’s secret sauce: Slack isn’t selling software; Slack is selling a positive user experience.

Slack is really selling is organizational transformation by changing how team members relate to one another, which improves productivity.

> 简单来说，就是 PLG 的前提条件是用户体验。
