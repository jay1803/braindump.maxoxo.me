## What is Money, Anyway? {#what-is-money-anyway}

we basically have four things we can do with our resources: consume, save,
invest, or share.

-   [Consume]({{<relref "20220329171507-consume.md#" >}}): When we consume, we meet our immediate needs and desires, including
    shelter, food, and entertainment.
-   [Saving]({{<relref "20210212173637-saving.md#" >}}): When we save, we store our resources in something that is safe,
    liquid, and portable, a.k.a. money. This serves as a low-risk battery of
    future resource consumption across time and space.
-   [Invest]({{<relref "20210804233916-investment.md#" >}}): When we invest, we commit resources to a project that has a decent
    likelihood of multiplying our resources but also comes with a risk of losing
    them, by trying to provide some new value to ourselves or others.There are
    personal investments, like our own business or education, and there are
    external financial investments in companies or projects led by other people.
-   [Share]({{<relref "20220329171622-share.md#" >}}): When we share, or in other words give to charity and those in our
    community, we give some portion of our excess resources to those that we deem
    to be needing and deserving.

The majority of people in the world don’t invest in financial assets; they are
still on the consumption stage (basic necessities and daily entertainment) or
the saving stage (money and home equity), either due to income constraints,
consumption excesses, or because they live in part of the world that doesn’t
have well-developed capital markets.

In developing countries that tend to have a more recent and extreme history of
currency devaluation, people often put more thought into what type of money they
hold. They might try to minimize how much cash they hold and keep it in hard
assets, or they might hold foreign currency, for example.

history of [Money]({{<relref "20210212111819-money.md#" >}})
comparable to the turning points of 1971-present (Petrodollar System), 1944-1971
(Bretton Woods System), the 1700s-1944 (Gold Standard System), and various
commodity-money transition periods (pre-1700s).

If we condense those stages to the basics, the world has gone through three
phases: commodity money, gold standard (the final form of commodity money), and
fiat currency.

A fourth phase, digital money, is on the horizon. This includes private digital
assets (e.g. bitcoin and stablecoins) and public digital currencies (e.g.
central bank digital currencies) that can change how we do banking, and what
economic tools policymakers have in terms of fiscal and monetary policy.


### Commodity Money {#commodity-money}

> Money is not an invention of the state. It is not the product of a legislative
> act. Even the sanction of political authority is not necessary for its
> existence. Certain commodities came to be money quite naturally, as the result
> of economic relationships that were independent of the power of the state.

> -Carl Menger, 1840-1921

The more complex an economy becomes...the society begins requiring something
divisible and universally acceptable.

In this way of thinking, [Money]({{<relref "20210212111819-money.md#" >}}) should be divisible, portable, durable, fungible,
verifiable, and scarce.

-   Divisible means the money can be sub-divided into various sizes to take into
    account different sizes of purchases.
-   Portable means the money is easy to move across distances, which means it has
    to pack a lot of value into a small weight.
-   Durable means the money is easy to save across time; it does not rot or rust
    or break easily.
-   Fungible means that individual units of the money don’t differ significantly
    from each other, which allows for fast transactions.
-   Verifiable means that the seller of the goods or services for the money can
    check that the money is what it really appears to be.
-   Scarce means that the money supply does not change quickly, since a rapid
    change in supply would devalue existing units.
-   Utility means that the money is intrinsically desirable in some way; it can be
    consumed or has aesthetic value, for example.

> Back in 1912, Mr. J.P. Morgan testified before Congress and is quoted as having said the famous line:
>
> Gold is money. Everything else is credit.

We can define [Currency]({{<relref "20210925231008-currency.md#" >}}) as a [Liability]({{<relref "20220203121151-liability.md#" >}}) of an institution, typically either a
commercial bank or a central bank, that is used as a medium of exchange and unit
of account.

In contrast to currency, we can define [Money]({{<relref "20210212111819-money.md#" >}}) as a liquid and fungible asset that
is not also a liability.

In some eras, [Money]({{<relref "20210212111819-money.md#" >}}) was held by banks as a reserve asset in order to support the
[Currency]({{<relref "20210925231008-currency.md#" >}}) that they issue as [Liability]({{<relref "20220203121151-liability.md#" >}}).

Under [Gold Standard]({{<relref "20220331125416-gold_standard.md#" >}}) systems, [Currency]({{<relref "20210925231008-currency.md#" >}}) represented a claim for [Money]({{<relref "20210212111819-money.md#" >}}). The bank
would pay the bearer on demand if they came to redeem their banknote paper
currency for its pegged amount of gold.

A good concept to be familiar with here is the [Stock-to-Flow Ratio]({{<relref "20220331135813-stock_to_flow_ratio.md#" >}}), which
measures how much supply there currently exists in the region or world (the
stock) divided by how much new supply can be produced in a year (the flow).

high [Stock-to-Flow Ratio]({{<relref "20220331135813-stock_to_flow_ratio.md#" >}}) tends to be the best way to measure scarcity for
something to be considered [Money]({{<relref "20210212111819-money.md#" >}}), along with the other attributes on the list
above, rather than absolute rarity.

Gold is the best among just about every attribute, and is the commodity with by
far the highest stock-to-flow ratio.

silver has actually been the winner in terms of usage. It has the second-best
score after gold across the board for most attributes, and the second highest
stock-to-flow ratio

Censorship-resistance is a significant feature when it comes to payments, and
self-custodying money that cannot be diluted with more supply is a significant
feature when it comes to savings.
