## Messaging: The key to getting prospects excited about your offering {#messaging-the-key-to-getting-prospects-excited-about-your-offering}

People like to learn about things in the context of their needs.

When building a website, use a journalistic point of view, leading with the punchline of why your product matters to your audience, and then developing the supporting arguments after your core point is made.

I noticed that quite a few PLG SaaS companies leverage users’ fear of missing out ([FOMO]({{< relref "20221019171908-fear_of_missing_out.md" >}})) to drive credibility and desirability throughout the website. For many companies, FOMO could simply be displaying customer logos, while for enterprise-focused businesses, they may use something more like a Forrester Wave or Gartner Magic Quadrant report.

Some startups take this to the next level by displaying users’ **love/like tweets**, **emails**, and **user testimonials**.

Data from our [2022 Product Benchmarks](https://openviewpartners.com/2022-product-benchmarks/) report revealed that organizations whose first GTM hire was a marketing expert had the highest signup rates, even at scale.


## Design: Not just for app interfaces anymore {#design-not-just-for-app-interfaces-anymore}

Remember, show and tell isn’t just for kindergarteners. Showing off the product via gif, video or other animation are all the rage right now.

Whether these users understand it consciously or not, they want to be told that other people are using your product (leading to FOMO). One way to help fulfill this subconscious need is to show people on your website, too.


## Deployment: Shipping and testing as you learn {#deployment-shipping-and-testing-as-you-learn}

As you begin to learn more about your customers and start to see growth in your product, your positioning will feel like it is ever changing. With a moving target, how do you know when to ship? The answer is to iterate and learn.

## 5 key findings: {#5-key-findings}


### Messaging {#messaging}

-   PLG websites revolve around people, not product features: People want to know how your product is going to make them look good. That’s all that matters.
-   Great websites use an inverted pyramid to tell their story: The most important, most convincing line of copy that answers “Why this?” must go at the very top. All copy below that should answer common questions and convince skeptics.
-   Create FOMO: Messaging must imply that the smartest, most in-the-know people in the industry rely on your product—and if you want to keep up with them, you’ve got to get on board.


### Design {#design}

-   Show, don’t tell: When possible, show the product in action by using a video or animation that plays on page load and loops.
-   Focus on people: Using photos of real people makes it easier for potential customers to picture themselves using your product.
