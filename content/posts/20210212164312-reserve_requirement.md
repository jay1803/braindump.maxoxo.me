指商业银行的初级存款中不能用于放贷的部分的比例。
The reserve requirement is a [Central Bank]({{<relref "20210212163458-central_bank.md#" >}}) regulation that sets the minimum
amount of reserves that must be held by a [Commercial Bank]({{<relref "20210212164623-commercial_bank.md#" >}}). The minimum reserve
is generally determined by the central bank to be no less than a specified
percentage of the amount of deposit liabilities the commercial bank owes to
its customers.
