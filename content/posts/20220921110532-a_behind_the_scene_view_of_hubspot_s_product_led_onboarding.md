User education is synonymous with the unicorn’s product-led onboarding activations but unlike many people’s beliefs, there is not a definitive answer, as to when and where in-app tactics should be placed. Simply because users’ behavior per segment differs dramatically. The product growth group runs all kinds of experiments based on feedback that originates from research, support tickets, or the customer-facing teams.

the product growth group had a team focused on acquisition, onboarding, retention, and monetization. The group included user researchers, product analysts, and marketers that acted as shared resources. At the same time, each of the individual teams was constituted by a triad (product manager, UX designer, tech lead) and software engineers.

In Hubspot’s instance, the onboarding team functions as the connective tissue between those departments. The team understands the connection across all products by anticipating context of usage, which equates to users’ motivations and goals asides from the product itself.
