### What is monetization? {#what-is-monetization}

[Monetization]({{<relref "20210731183422-monetization.md#" >}}) is the process of deriving revenue from the value you offer to your
users.

This revenue may or may not come from your users but it’s fair to suggest that
in exchange for the value you offer and deliver to your customers, you can
expect to be able to derive some form of remuneration from somewhere in return.
