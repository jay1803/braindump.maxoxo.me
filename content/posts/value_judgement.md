## DEFINITION {#definition}

is a judgment of the [Rightness]({{<relref "20210206093141-ethics.md#" >}}) or wrongness [Wrongdoing]({{<relref "20210727115312-wrongdoing.md#" >}}) of something or
someone, or of the [Usefulness]({{<relref "20210206091906-utility.md#" >}}) of something or someone, based on a comparison
or other relativity.

As a generalization, a value judgment can refer to a judgment based upon a
particular set of values or on a particular [Value System]({{<relref "20210727115830-value_system.md#" >}}). A related meaning of
value judgment is an expedient evaluation based upon limited information at
hand, where said evaluation was undertaken because a decision had to be made
on short notice.


## Quote {#quote}

A famous quote from mathematician G.H. Hardy indicates how he places the
"value-neutral" subject of mathematics into a particular social context: "A
science is said to be useful if its development tends to accentuate the
existing inequalities of wealth, or more directly promotes the destruction of
human life".


## Example {#example}

An item may have value and be value-neutral regardless of social context if
its utility or importance is more-or-less self-evident, for example, oxygen
supports life in all societies.
