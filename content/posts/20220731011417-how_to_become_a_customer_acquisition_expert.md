## Where You CAN’T Learn Customer Acquisition {#where-you-can-t-learn-customer-acquisition}

1.  There is no one unicorn course/source that will teach you everything you need.
2.  You will not learn digital marketing and customer acquisition in college.
3.  You will not become a customer acquisition expert by exclusively watching/reading endless courses and blogs.  At some point you just have to jump in and get your hands dirty.
4.  Certifications are bullshit.


## Learning Plan - Shape Yourself Like A “T” <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#learning-plan-shape-yourself-like-a-t}

I have tried to simplify the path as much as possible.  There are three layers:

1.  Base Layer
2.  Marketing Foundation
3.  Channel Expertise
    The third layer is where you will need to make some choices.

## Which Channels Should You Go Deep On? {#which-channels-should-you-go-deep-on}

But I’ll give you two things to consider as you are deciding.

1.  Your Preference and Skills
2.  Take A Bet On On An Emerging Channel


## Some General Tips {#some-general-tips}


### Get Something To Experiment With {#get-something-to-experiment-with}


### Learn From Others {#learn-from-others}


### Learn From Other Companies {#learn-from-other-companies}

For example, in content marketing I would pay attention to companies such as Moz, [HubSpot]({{< relref "20220110110120-hubspot.md" >}}), KissMetrics, and Buffer.  Use tools to research and follow their strategies such as Moz Research Tools, Followerwonk, SEMrush, WhatRunsWhere, and SocialCrawlytics.
