I'm going to focus on the 5 elements of Product Market Fit that I believe are most misunderstood and overlooked:

-   The wrong way to search for Product Market Fit.
-   Why we should be thinking about it as Market Product Fit.
-   How we defined our market and product hypotheses for early versions of HubSpot Sales.
-   What the search for market product fit looks like in reality, not just in theory.
-   Qualitative, Quantitative, and Intuitive signals of market product fit.


## Searching For Market Product Fit The Right Way {#searching-for-market-product-fit-the-right-way}

There were four key market elements that we looked at:

-   **Category**. What category of products does the customer put you in?
-   **Who**. Who is the target audience within the category? There are always multiple personas within a single category, so this breaks it down further.
-   **Problems**. What problems does your target audience have related to the category?
-   **Motivations**. What are the motivations behind those problems? Why are those problems important to your target audience?
