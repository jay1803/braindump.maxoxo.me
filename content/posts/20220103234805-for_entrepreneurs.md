## About {#about}

The articles I write for this site are another tool I enjoy providing
entrepreneurs to help them start their companies. If you are looking for a great
place to start, I would recommend the following page: [Matrix Growth Academy â€“
Zero to 100 Videos]({{<relref "20210812094207-matrix_growth_academy_zero_to_100_videos.md#" >}}), where you will find a collection of short videos and
associated slide decks covering the most important startup lessons that I have
learned over the years.
