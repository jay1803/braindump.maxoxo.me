## DEFINITION {#definition}

In positive psychology, a ****flow state****, also known colloquially as being in
****the zone****, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is
fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and
enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by
the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in
one's sense of time.


## Characteristic {#characteristic}

3.  不觉他物：专注投入事物之中，导致不易察觉像是饥饿、手机震动等感觉与刺激。
4.  感到愉悦：在事情完成后，感受到愉悦、满足、成就感等正向情绪。
