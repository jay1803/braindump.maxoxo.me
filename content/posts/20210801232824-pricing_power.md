## 定价权 {#定价权}

Pricing power is an economic term that describes the effect of a change in a
firm's product price on the quantity demanded of that
product. Pricing power is linked to the [Price Elasticity of Demand](price-elasticity-of-demand.md). Price
elasticity is a measure of the degree to which individuals, consumers, or
producers change their demand or the amount supplied in response to price
changes. For example, if the price of a good goes up, the tendency is that the
demand for that good will go down as people will look for cheaper
alternatives.
