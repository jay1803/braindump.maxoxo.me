## Modern GTM playbook for B2B SaaS <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#modern-gtm-playbook-for-b2b-saas}

How to build a high-growth engine for business software start-ups

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220711_171434screenshot.png" >}}

The phenomenal success of hyper-growth companies like [Slack]({{< relref "20211230134357-slack.md" >}}), [Dropbox]({{< relref "20211230140136-dropbox.md" >}}), [Atlassian]({{< relref "20220711171528-atlassian.md" >}}), [Datadog]({{< relref "20220711171604-datadog.md" >}}) and [Snowflake]({{< relref "20220711171622-snowflake.md" >}}) has triggered many discussions about modern go-to-market ([GTM]({{< relref "20210812231906-go_to_market.md" >}})) methods for B2B [SaaS]({{< relref "20210701230836-saas.md" >}}), including [PLG]({{< relref "20220707205151-product_led_growth.md" >}}), [PLS]({{< relref "20220711171824-product_led_sales.md" >}}), [Community-Led]({{< relref "20220711171857-community_led.md" >}}), [ABM]({{< relref "20220711171940-account_based_marketing.md" >}}), Marketplace and others.


### PHASE 1: find the PMF <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#phase-1-find-the-pmf}

![](/ox-hugo/_20220711_172114screenshot.png)
In phase 1, the actions are as follows:

-   Build a community of co-creators
-   Find [Product-Market Fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}})

Run a survey to ask users how disappointed they would be if the product did not exist. If 40%[^fn:1] are very disappointed you have achieved PMF.

### PHASE 2: build a PLG flywheel <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#phase-2-build-a-plg-flywheel}

Phases 2–5 focus on developing the go-to-market fit (GTM-fit) and building the growth engine.

The objective of phase 2 is to build a product-led-growth (PLG) flywheel – the backbone of your growth engine.
A [Flywheel]({{< relref "20220328174125-flywheel.md" >}}) is, in contrast to a funnel, a self-amplifying system.

Product-related network effects are also important and can be achieved by adding collaboration features. This is the type of [Word-of-Mouth]({{< relref "20220711173326-word_of_mouth.md" >}}) (WOM) and in-product network effect we want to create in phase 2.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220711_173210screenshot.png" >}}

In phase 2, the actions are as follows:

-   Build self-serve [User Onboarding]({{< relref "20220704195112-user_onboarding.md" >}}): focus your product development on programming the entire onboarding process into the product without a human in the loop.
    You can find more info about self-serve onboarding techniques [Product-Led Growth:How to Build a Product That Sells Itself]({{< relref "20220630224517-product_led_growth_how_to_build_a_product_that_sells_itself.md" >}}) and [Product-Led Onboarding: How to Turn New Users Into Lifelong Customers]({{< relref "20220711200616-product_led_onboarding_how_to_turn_new_users_into_lifelong_customers.md" >}}).
-   Implement [Freemium]({{< relref "20220703193346-freemium.md" >}}) or [Free Trial]({{< relref "20220703192450-free_trial.md" >}})
    More information about the advantages of freemium or free trial can be found [Free Trial vs. Freemium: Use the MOAT Framework to Decide]({{< relref "20220711201011-free_trial_vs_freemium_use_the_moat_framework_to_decide.md" >}}).
-   Add collaboration features: This is a fantastic way to “market” your product and a great way to generate network effects.Find more ways to create network effects [The Cold Start Problem]({{< relref "20211211004603-the_cold_start_problem.md" >}}).
-   Add referral features: For example, when someone gives you an outstanding Net Promoter Score (9 or 10), provide a link and encouragement to leave a review at G2 or your website.
-   Build a brand: Position your brand either to disrupt a practice or champion a role (more here [Branding: Are You a Dragon Slayer or Patron Saint?]({{< relref "20220711202219-branding_are_you_a_dragon_slayer_or_patron_saint.md" >}})). Build your [SEO]({{< relref "20220118175814-search_engine_optimization.md" >}}) architecture around your product [USP]({{< relref "20220711202504-unique_selling_proposition.md" >}}) and real human questions to drive sales. More on Product-led SEO can be found [Product-Led SEO: The Why Behind Building Your Organic Growth Strategy]({{< relref "20220711203150-product_led_seo_the_why_behind_building_your_organic_growth_strategy.md" >}}).
-   Establish a success team: Don’t hire people with an issue-to-resolution mindset, hire people with an issue-to-retention mindset to drive the net retention rate (NRR).
-   Establish a growth team: establish a growth team with members from product management, engineering, marketing and success. More on team organization and activities can be found [Hacking Growth: How Today’s Fastest-Growing Companies Drive Breakout Success]({{< relref "20210814215334-hacking_growth_how_today_s_fastest_growing_companies_drive_breakout_success.md" >}}).
-   Serve the community: the community is a micro version of your total market that gives you direct access to the topics, ideas, wants, and needs of your current and potential customers.
-   Implement a data platform: You can deploy a customer data platform (CDP) or build a modern data stack (MDS) with a data warehouse to consolidate the data from all the different tools you will deploy over time e.g., product analytics, marketing, success, CRM.

Phase 2 is an ongoing optimization, without a defined end point. [The top quartile achieve web-to-signup conversions of 10% and free-to-paid conversations of 27%](https://openviewpartners.com/2021-product-benchmarks/#.YdWM_mjMJaQ).

By following this product-led-growth flywheel, your ARR will increase and your customer acquisition cost (CAC), gross profit and NRR will improve step-by-step.

### PHASE 3: add a PLS amplifier <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#phase-3-add-a-pls-amplifier}

To boost the conversion rate in mid markets and/or to enable selling to enterprises, phase 3 adds a product-led sales (PLS) amplifier to the PLG flywheel.
[PLS]({{< relref "20220711171824-product_led_sales.md" >}}) is based on strong user self-qualifications with clear behavioral indicators that a group of users inside an account are ready to purchase.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220711_203946screenshot.png" >}}

In phase 3, the actions are as follows:

-   Define product qualified leads (PQL): a PQL is typically a combination of
    1.  the number of times the user has returned to the product,
    2.  the number of features the user has tested, and
    3.  how soon after signing up the user tries out additional features. More information about defining PQLs can be found here and here.
-   Establish an inside sales team:
-   Add enterprise-grade features: additional features will be required like improved security, single-sign-on, SLA support, audit logging, etc.

Bear in mind that your goal is to let users self-serve their purchase as much as possible, without the inside sales rep, as this is cheaper and scales better.

### PHASE 4: add a field-sales amplifier <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#phase-4-add-a-field-sales-amplifier}

For a limited number of your largest ICP accounts (key-accounts) it makes sense to overlay a classical sales-led-growth motion on top of your PLG flywheel.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220711_204302screenshot.png" >}}

In phase 4, the actions are as follows:

-   Implement account based marketing (ABM): [ABM]({{< relref "20220711171940-account_based_marketing.md" >}}) monitors the purchase intent of your key-accounts before they even visit your website. Tools track all the search behavior inside these accounts to help you predict their buying stage (target, awareness, consideration, decision, purchase).
-   Establish a field sales team: now it’s time to bring in a quota-carrying sales team, the people who pitch your value to executives in key-accounts. combining field sales with the self-serve PLG flywheel comes into play when the proof-of-concept (POC) for your product starts. You can find more information about combining field sales with a PLG backbone [Enterprise software leaders: add a PLG backbone in 2022]({{< relref "20220711204757-enterprise_software_leaders_add_a_plg_backbone_in_2022.md" >}}).

Field sales can be a real ARR amplifier for PLG, but only for large customers or customers with significant potential.

### PHASE 5: build a partner eco-system <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#phase-5-build-a-partner-eco-system}

it’s time to leverage your customer base and brand to build a partner eco-system.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220711_204623screenshot.png" >}}

In phase 5, the actions are as follows:

-   Build an app &amp; content store: leverage your customer base to build an app &amp; content store as a channel for ISV partners, while still using your existing credit-card purchase infrastructure to bill your customers and pay your partners.
-   Use indirect channels: leverage your brand and integrate your product into the app &amp; content stores of other ISVs and SI offerings. Note that while good attach rates are only 1%–2%[^fn:2], a major app store like Salesforce with 150,000 customers could deliver 1,000 new accounts.
-   Establish a channel partner team: build a dedicated channel partner team to grow your partner network and manage these relationships.

The partner eco-system is typically the icing on the cake because it leverages the customer base and brand you’ve built in the previous phases.

### Summary {#summary}

Of course, all the methods and techniques must be carefully reviewed in the context of your own offering.
