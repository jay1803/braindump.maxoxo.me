## 5 psychological triggers to spark a successful user activation {#5-psychological-triggers-to-spark-a-successful-user-activation}

To make your user [Activation]({{<relref "20210906161249-activation.md#" >}}) successful...The answer is by implementing
psychological triggers in your user activation strategy. Every human decision is
based on a psychological influence. Let’s take the same example of sales here.

Selling any product or services to your audiences involves some kind of hidden
psychological trigger.

For example: An Insurance agent will convince you to buy a policy by emphasizing on words like- life security, family security, low premium and so on, which acts as a trigger that echos in your head somewhat like this…

“OK so I get security for life, my family will be safe in my absence and all of it at an affordable premium, so I am totally buying it!”

This is how psychological trigger works in influencing people to make a desired
decision.

According to a research, [65 percent](https://www.catchpoint.com/blog/mobile-performance) of users say a poor mobile experience
negatively impacts their opinion on the brand.

To activate a user, you need to first understand their psychological expectation from the product.

-   What do users want from the app?
-   What goals are they trying to accomplish?
-   In which stage of the user journey they are in currently?
-   What has kept them active in the first place?

For instance, an app that has [contextual walkthroughs and nudges](https://netcorecloud.com/product-experience/app-walkthroughs-contextual-nudges/) to guide users
to the app’s important functions are more likely to stay put, as they are
well-informed users.

Here are some of the popular psychological concepts you must use to activate new
users and make your app tick.

-   The Zeigarnik Effect – Remind users about their unfinished tasks
-   Paradox of Choice – Limit the choices to help users make better decisions
-   The Peer Pressure Effect – Influence one user to invite new users.
-   Endowed Progress Effect – Give users a head start to complete the goals.
-   Ambiguity Effect – Equip users with adequate information to make decisions.
-   Resistance Psychology – Identify user resistance and alter your actions.
