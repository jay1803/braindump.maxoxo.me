## WHAT IS PRODUCT-LED GROWTH? {#what-is-product-led-growth}

Product-led growth ([PLG]({{< relref "20220707205151-product_led_growth.md" >}})) is an end user-focused growth model that relies on the product itself as the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion.


## Product-led growth, explained {#product-led-growth-explained}

Companies with a [PLG]({{< relref "20220707205151-product_led_growth.md" >}}) strategy—think [Slack]({{< relref "20211230134357-slack.md" >}}), [Calendly]({{< relref "20220721011204-calendly.md" >}}) and [Dropbox]({{< relref "20211230140136-dropbox.md" >}})
it’s rightfully associated with viral, [Freemium]({{< relref "20220703193346-freemium.md" >}}), [Bottom-Up Sales]({{< relref "20220702150735-bottom_up_sales.md" >}}) distribution, product-led growth is more than a simple go-to-market formula.
The center of power has shifted from the buyer to the end user.

The [Natural Rate of Growth]({{< relref "20220721013015-natural_rate_of_growth.md" >}}) (NRG) succeeds where traditional SaaS metrics fall short.

The formula looks like this:
Natural Rate of Growth = 100 x Annual Growth Rate x Organic Signups (%) x ARR from Products (%)

What’s great about the Natural Rate of Growth is that it:

-   Provides companies with a strong indicator of future revenue.
-   Can be tracked from the early days of monetization all the way through to IPO.
-   Applies to all software companies, no matter where they are in PLG maturity.
-   Is easily measurable without sophisticated processes or tooling.
-   Can identify whether a business can drive efficient growth via the product itself.
