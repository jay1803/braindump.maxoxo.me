## The aha moment guide: How to find, optimize, and design for your product's aha moment {#the-aha-moment-guide-how-to-find-optimize-and-design-for-your-product-s-aha-moment}


### What is the [Aha Moment]({{<relref "20211104132111-aha_moment.md#" >}})? {#what-is-the-aha-moment--20211104132111-aha-moment-dot-md}

In software, it’s the pivotal moment when a new user first realizes the value of
your product and why they need it.

For a ride-sharing app with a simple user journey, it might look like this:

a SaaS product with a more complex path to value?

In the example above, a new user might even experience multiple aha moments, as
the value of the product really sinks in.


### How to find your product's aha moment {#how-to-find-your-product-s-aha-moment}

The moment that things click—when a user realizes that they can truly benefit
from your app—is their [Aha Moment]({{<relref "20211104132111-aha_moment.md#" >}}).


#### Start with patterns in your user analytics data {#start-with-patterns-in-your-user-analytics-data}

Did the users who convert:

-   Finish your onboarding experience?
-   Continue browsing your app after the product tour?
-   Interact with a core feature?
-   Connect with other users?

Put together a list of 10 to 20 behaviors (or a combination of behaviors) that
you believe correlates to retained users. You're looking for a set of behaviors
exhibited by users who stay and not behaviors exhibited by users who leave. That
means behavior exhibited by:

-   Most retained users AND by most churned users = no correlation
-   A few retained users AND by a few churned users = no correlation
-   Most retained users AND by a few churned users = correlation.


#### Supplement with user feedback {#supplement-with-user-feedback}

Talking to people on the phone will give you supplementary information that the
numbers cannot.


#### Learn from churned users {#learn-from-churned-users}

Users churn either because 1) they're not a good fit for the product, or 2)
because friction in the experience kept them from finding value. If it's the
latter, this is your opportunity to target and eliminate the friction, so that
more of those churned users start sticking around.
