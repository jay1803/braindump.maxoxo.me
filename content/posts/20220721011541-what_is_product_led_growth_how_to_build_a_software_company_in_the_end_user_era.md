It used to be hard for a company to adopt new software. Long sales processes, complex implementation, formal training and certification—the list goes on.

But today, software just shows up in the workplace unannounced. End users are finding products on their own and telling their bosses which ones to buy. And it’s all happening at lightning speed.

In its [S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019006616/slacks-1a1.htm), Slack stated, “Many organizations adopt Slack initially as part of our self-service go-to-market approach. Organic growth is generated as users realize the benefits of Slack.”


## Product led growth: How did we get here? {#product-led-growth-how-did-we-get-here}


## A history of software in three eras {#a-history-of-software-in-three-eras}


### 1. The CIO Era {#1-dot-the-cio-era}

back to the 80s and 90s
The CIO was the buyer and her key decision-making criteria was IT compatibility—will this product work in my environment?

During this period, software distribution was defined as [Sales-Led Growth]({{< relref "20220708021435-sales_led_growth.md" >}}) with blazer-clad field sales reps taking CIOs out to fancy steak dinners in hopes of winning the RFP.


### 2. The Exec Era {#2-dot-the-exec-era}

began in the 2000s
The decision-making criteria was now all about the ROI and the KPIs—will this product help our team achieve its goals?

These huge paradigm shifts brought us “marketing-led growth” as a distribution model, and we all started using fun terms like MQL and SDR for the first time.


### 3. The End User Era {#3-dot-the-end-user-era}

we come to the present day and the End User Era.
The decision-making criteria is now personal productivity—will this product actually help me day-to-day?

Software distribution today is best described as “product led growth,” and it looks a lot like consumer growth models.

## What is product led growth? {#what-is-product-led-growth}

Product led growth is an end user-focused growth model that relies on the product itself as the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion.


## How to build a product for end users {#how-to-build-a-product-for-end-users}

two fundamental principles:

-   Design is not enough
-   Solve end user pain


### Design is not enough {#design-is-not-enough}

[Design First]({{< relref "20221102150908-design_first.md" >}}) first became critical to software success around 2011-2012


### Solve end user pain {#solve-end-user-pain}

Every software product has two possible personas: executives and end users. And they each think about pain very differently.

you must remove the friction from the process by:

-   Distributing your product where users live
-   Making it easy to get started
-   Delivering value before the paywall
-   Hiring sales last


### Distribute where they live {#distribute-where-they-live}

End users are always looking for solutions to their pain. Your job is to make it easy for them to find your product.


## How to distribute a product to end users {#how-to-distribute-a-product-to-end-users}

If your end users live in Chrome, distribute through the Chrome Web Store. If they live in Slack, distribute through the Slack App Directory.


### Make it easy to get started {#make-it-easy-to-get-started}

Friction in the signup and onboarding funnels is usually caused by humans.
Remove the humans from your signup and onboarding funnel, or end users will abandon the funnel.


### Deliver value before the paywall {#deliver-value-before-the-paywall}

What is the [Aha Moment]({{< relref "20211104132111-aha_moment.md" >}}) in your product? For [Zoom]({{< relref "20211230134512-zoom.md" >}}), it’s after you’ve hosted your first meeting. For [Expensify]({{< relref "20221103150552-expensify.md" >}}), it comes at the end of the month when you realize your expense report is ready to submit and all you did was snap a few pictures.


### Hire sales last {#hire-sales-last}

In the old world of sales led growth and marketing led growth, you couldn’t get new customers without salespeople.
in the End User Era, hunting for executives with budget is a losing proposition.


## Product led growth is not just a trend—it’s taking over {#product-led-growth-is-not-just-a-trend-it-s-taking-over}

Shopify, Dropbox, Twilio, Slack, Zoom and Atlassian have recognized that we are in the End User Era, and they’re all-in on product led growth.

Post-IPO, PLG companies perform better than other companies, including the non-PLG SaaS companies that were built for the bygone eras of selling to CIOs and Execs.
