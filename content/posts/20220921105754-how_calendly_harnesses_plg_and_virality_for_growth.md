## Product led growth: An all-in affair {#product-led-growth-an-all-in-affair}

Calendly is a truly viral product. There is no single user version of engagement with Calendly; it’s only relevant when there are at least two people involved—the meeting planner and the meeting invitee.


## The long-term Plan: Optimizing your viral factor {#the-long-term-plan-optimizing-your-viral-factor}


## The bottom line: It’s all about solving problems {#the-bottom-line-it-s-all-about-solving-problems}

There may be all kinds of complex strategies and tactics rolled up under PLG: good product-market fit, viral loops and more; but at the end of the day it all boils down to one simple core idea: Solve your customer’s problems.
