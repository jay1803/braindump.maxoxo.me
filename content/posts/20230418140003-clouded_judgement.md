published on Friday mornings I’ll break down the latest valuation trends (and the operating metrics driving these changes) behind the universe of Cloud / [SaaS]({{< relref "20210701230836-saas.md" >}}) public companies. Over the years as a [venture capitalist]({{< relref "20230418140202-venture_capitalist.md" >}}) I’ve developed frameworks (many of them data driven) to evaluate private SaaS businesses that are broadly applicable to their public counterparts.
