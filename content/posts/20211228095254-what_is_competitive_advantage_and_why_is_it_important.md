A competitive advantage enables a company to perform better than its
competitors. It refers to factors allowing a company to produce services or
goods better or for less expense than the competition, which may generate more
sales or higher profit margins. To be successful, a company's competitive
advantage must generate value for its stakeholders and be difficult for others
to reproduce.

Companies could have a variety of competitive advantages, including:

-   Cost structure
-   Product quality
-   Branding
-   Customer service
-   Intellectual property
-   Distribution network

There are six types of competitive advantage you can make use of:

-   Differential: This advantage means you offer products with a more unique
    benefit than the competition, such as better quality or quicker service.
-   Cost-leading: This advantage involves the production of goods or services
    equal to competitors but offered at lower prices.
-   Market-focused: This advantage targets pre-defined markets instead of one
    large market to reach a specific demographic.
-   Brand: This advantage encourages brand loyalty by offering a unique or
    superior brand with image, positioning and strategies, or by continuously
    updating features.
-   Network: This advantage refers to subscription services using member benefits
    or bonus incentives.
-   Resource: This advantage refers to a company's edge because of limited access
    to resources or materials for production.
