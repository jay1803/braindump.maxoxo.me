## RICE: Simple prioritization for product managers {#rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers}


### Prioritization is a difficult problem {#prioritization-is-a-difficult-problem}


### RICE score: a simple tool for prioritization {#rice-score-a-simple-tool-for-prioritization}


### RICE: Four factors for assessing priority {#rice-four-factors-for-assessing-priority}

[RICE]({{<relref "20211102135254-ice_framework.md#" >}}) is an acronym for the four factors we use to evaluate each project idea:
reach, impact, confidence and effort.


#### Reach {#reach}

Reach is measured in number of people/events per time period. That might be
“customers per quarter” or “transactions per month”. As much as possible, use
real measurements from product metrics instead of pulling numbers from a hat.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Example

    -   Project 1: 500 customers reach this point in the signup funnel each month, and
        30% choose this option. The reach is 500 × 30% × 3 = 450 customers per
        quarter.
    -   Project 2: Every customer who uses this feature each quarter will see this
        change. The reach is 2,000 customers per quarter.
    -   Project 3: This change will have a one-time effect on 800 existing customers,
        with no ongoing effect. The reach is 800 customers per quarter.


#### Impact {#impact}

Estimate the impact on an individual person.
Choosing an impact number may seem unscientific. But remember the alternative: a
tangled mess of gut feeling.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Example

    -   Project 1: For each customer who sees it, this will have a huge impact. The
        impact score is 3.
    -   Project 2: This will have a lesser impact for each customer. The impact score
        is 1.
    -   Project 3: This is somewhere in-between in terms of impact. The impact score
        is 2.


#### Confidence {#confidence}

If you think a project could have huge impact but don’t have data to back it up,
confidence lets you control that.

Be honest with yourself: how much support do you really have for your estimates?

<!--list-separator-->

-  Example

    -   Project 1: We have quantitative metrics for reach, user research for impact,
        and an engineering estimate for effort. This project gets a 100% confidence
        score.
    -   Project 2: I have data to support the reach and effort, but I’m unsure about
        the impact. This project gets an 80% confidence score.
    -   Project 3: The reach and impact may be lower than estimated, and the effort
        may be higher. This project gets a 50% confidence score.


#### Effort {#effort}

estimate the total amount of time a project will require from all members of
your team: product, design, and engineering.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Example

    -   Project 1: This will take about a week of planning, 1-2 weeks of design, and
        2-4 weeks of engineering time. I’ll give it an effort score of 2
        person-months.
    -   Project 2: This project will take several weeks of planning, a significant
        amount of design time, and at least two months of one engineer’s time. I’ll
        give it an effort score of 4 person-months.
    -   Project 3: This only requires a week of planning, no new design, and a few
        weeks of engineering time. I’ll give it an effort score of 1 person-month.
