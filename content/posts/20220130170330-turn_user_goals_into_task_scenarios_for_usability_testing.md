## Turn User Goals into Task Scenarios for Usability Testing {#turn-user-goals-into-task-scenarios-for-usability-testing}


### What Users Need To Be Able To Do {#what-users-need-to-be-able-to-do}

In order to observe participants you need to give them something to do. These
assignments are frequently referred to as tasks.
Rather than simply ordering test users to "do X" with no explanation, it's
better to situate the request within a short scenario
 Ask yourself: What are the most important things that every user must be able
to accomplish on the site?


### Engage Users with Task Scenarios {#engage-users-with-task-scenarios}

For example, a task scenario could be:

> You're planning a vacation to New York City, March 3 − March 14. You need to buy
> both airfare and hotel. Go to the American Airlines site and jetBlue Airlines
> site and see who has the best deals.
