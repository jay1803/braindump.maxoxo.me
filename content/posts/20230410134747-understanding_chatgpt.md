## About {#about}

[ChatGPT]({{< relref "20230327162227-openai.md#chatgpt" >}}) falls under the branch of deep learning known as [natural language processing]({{< relref "20230512173739-natural_language_processing.md" >}}), or NLP. NLP encompasses a variety of activities, including text classification (sentiment analysis and spam filtering, for example), keyword extraction, named-entity recognition, document summarization, and question answering â€“ posing a question in plain English and searching a corpus of text for an answer. One of the more ambitious tasks to which NLP is applied is neural machine translation, or NMT, which translates text into other languages.
