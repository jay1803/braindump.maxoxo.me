## Model Market Fit <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#model-market-fit}

[Model Market Fit]({{< relref "20210828150834-model_market_fit.md" >}}) is the concept that your market (and # of customers within your market) influence your model.

On the Y-Axis is the average annual revenue per customer that you generate from your model. On the X-Axis is the total number of customers you need to create a $100M+ Business.

## Understanding If You Have Model Market Fit {#understanding-if-you-have-model-market-fit}

Your Model Market Fit hypothesis revolves around some simple math:
ARPU x Total Customers In Market x % You Think You Can Capture &gt;= $100M

I recommend thinking through them in this order:


#### Total Customers In Market {#total-customers-in-market}

First, define your target market. You should have done this already at the [Market Product Fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}) stage anyway.


#### ARPU {#arpu}

After you have defined the market, you can do some qualitative research to understand what their willingness to pay is for your solution to build your [ARPU]({{< relref "20210729003208-average_revenue_per_account.md" >}}) hypothesis.


#### % You Can Capture {#you-can-capture}

If you have nailed down your target market and know how many target customers there are and you understand what they might be willing to pay (ARPU) you can back into the % of the market you need to capture to create a $100M+ business.


## Moving from Market to Market {#moving-from-market-to-market}

I also typically recommend starting with a [niche market]({{< relref "20210530161302-niche_market.md" >}}) in the earliest days and then expanding out.
when you use the Model Market Fit equation with the niche market, it never ends up equaling &gt;$100M.

The more times you need to expand to get to a $100M+ business, the riskier your core hypothesis is. Every time you expand there is risk that your four fits don't hold true.
