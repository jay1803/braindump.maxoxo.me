Jira software was founded in 2002 by two Computer Science students in Sydney.


## What does Jira mean? {#what-does-jira-mean}

The name [Jira]({{< relref "20221007115052-jira.md" >}}) comes from Godjira or Japanese for Godzilla


## What does Atlassian mean? {#what-does-atlassian-mean}

The name [Atlassian]({{< relref "20220711171528-atlassian.md" >}}) comes from Atlas in Greek mythology, a titan condemned to hold up the heavens or sky for eternity
podcast interview with Atlassian founders called “How I built this with Guy Raz”. Oh, and Atlassian is the adjective format of Atlas; atlas.com was taken! :P


## How did Atlassian start? {#how-did-atlassian-start}

Atlassian co-founders [Mike Cannon-Brookes]({{< relref "20221012100640-mike_cannon_brookes.md" >}}) and [Scott Farquhar]({{< relref "20221012100653-scott_farquhar.md" >}}) met in 1998 while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, both on a Computer Science Co-op scholarship.

In 2001 however, Mike sent an email to his course mates asking who’d want to help him launch a tech startup after graduation, and Scott was the only one to respond… and that was that.

Back in the day, Atlassian offered third-party tech support


### When was Jira created? {#when-was-jira-created}

Atlassian co-founders Mike and Scott wrote a support system in 2002 that they named the Atlassian Support System, where people could file a ticket.


### From supporting software to building it {#from-supporting-software-to-building-it}

The first version of Jira took 3 months or so, then the 1.0 version, which was good enough for people to use, took around 6 months.


### Back when marketing Jira cost nothing {#back-when-marketing-jira-cost-nothing}

They’d attend software events and corner people to show them the product! They’d sneak in flyers and do all kinds of stunt marketing to get their names known.
