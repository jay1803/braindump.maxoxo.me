-   First, high performing growth teams focused on a single metric at a time.
-   Second, the North Star Metric evolved as the venture scaled.

### North Star Metric #1: Establish Flow of Free Users for Experimentation (i.e. new users per day) {#north-star-metric-1-establish-flow-of-free-users-for-experimentation--i-dot-e-dot-new-users-per-day}


### North Star Metric #2: Prove Free User Retention (i.e. New User-&gt;WAU%) <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#north-star-metric-2-prove-free-user-retention--i-dot-e-dot-new-user-wau}

prove that the product consistently delivers on the value promise.

-   first approach, from Brian Balfour, evaluates the usage retention of users, organized by acquisition date cohorts.
    definition of a usage retention metric. DAUs/WAUs/MAUs are common
    Following Balfour’s approach, the data is then organized into the model below, where each color represents a set of users acquired in a particular period, such as in the month of May, and the shape illustrates the percentage of those users that remain as free active users over time.

-   The second approach, from Sean Ellis, leverages a simple survey to assess the perceived importance of your product by the user.
    asking users a simple question, “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product”, and provides three response options, Not Disappointed, Somewhat Disappointed, or Very Disappointed. Ellis recommends calling victory on this stage when 40% or more state they would be “Very Disappointed”.


### North Star Metric #3: Prove Scalable Quality User Acquisition (i.e. Cost per Quality User) {#north-star-metric-3-prove-scalable-quality-user-acquisition--i-dot-e-dot-cost-per-quality-user}


### North Star Metric #4: Prove Monetization (i.e. Quality User-&gt;Paid User% AND ACV) {#north-star-metric-4-prove-monetization--i-dot-e-dot-quality-user-paid-user-and-acv}
