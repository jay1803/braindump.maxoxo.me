My students and I heard from the growth teams at Pinterest, Facebook, LinkedIn, Lyft, Shopify, Tesla, Adidas, the NBA, and Disney+ and held workshops led by growth thought leaders [Brian Balfour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bbalfour/) from Reforge and [Sean Ellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanellis/), author of Hacking Growth.

we recruited a handful of B2B startups, forming student teams to apply the patterns we observed in the class to their PLG strategy.


## Define and Navigate Four Sequential North Star Metrics <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#define-and-navigate-four-sequential-north-star-metrics}

Two interesting observations surfaced with regards to the metrics focus of the growth team.

-   First, high performing growth teams focused on a single metric at a time.
-   Second, the North Star Metric evolved as the venture scaled.

The sequence through

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220723_032356screenshot.png" >}}


### North Star Metric #1: Establish Flow of Free Users for Experimentation (i.e. new users per day) {#north-star-metric-1-establish-flow-of-free-users-for-experimentation--i-dot-e-dot-new-users-per-day}


### North Star Metric #2: Prove Free User Retention (i.e. New User-&gt;WAU%) <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#north-star-metric-2-prove-free-user-retention--i-dot-e-dot-new-user-wau}

prove that the product consistently delivers on the value promise.

-   first approach, from Brian Balfour, evaluates the usage retention of users, organized by acquisition date cohorts.
    LinkedIn nicely summarizes in this article how they defined a “Quality Signup” as an immediately measurable metric that correlated nicely with long term usage retention.

Following Balfour’s approach, the data is then organized into the model below, where each color represents a set of users acquired in a particular period, such as in the month of May, and the shape illustrates the percentage of those users that remain as free active users over time.

-   The second approach, from Sean Ellis, leverages a simple survey to assess the perceived importance of your product by the user.
    asking users a simple question, “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product”, and provides three response options, Not Disappointed, Somewhat Disappointed, or Very Disappointed. Ellis recommends calling victory on this stage when 40% or more state they would be “Very Disappointed”.

    In both cases, user segmentation is critical.
    This segment is often referred to as Quality Users amongst growth teams and the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) in B2B software companies. [This article by FirstRound Capital about Superhuman is a brilliant description of how they used segmentation with Ellis’ approach to find their Quality User definition](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit) and claim victory on Step #2.

### North Star Metric #3: Prove Scalable Quality User Acquisition (i.e. Cost per Quality User) {#north-star-metric-3-prove-scalable-quality-user-acquisition--i-dot-e-dot-cost-per-quality-user}


### North Star Metric #4: Prove Monetization (i.e. Quality User-&gt;Paid User% AND ACV) {#north-star-metric-4-prove-monetization--i-dot-e-dot-quality-user-paid-user-and-acv}


## Establish a Cross-Functional Team Reporting into Product, not Marketing {#establish-a-cross-functional-team-reporting-into-product-not-marketing}

These teams consisted of the following capabilities.

-   Product Managers: Receive input from the various constituents (team, users, product data, market data, competitive data) and drive prioritization of the experiment funnel.
-   Full-Stack Engineers: Split time between executing the aspects of experiments that require back-end coding and develop the tools used by non-technical resources to execute experiments.
-   Designers: Own the user interface and user experience of the product. Design ads, landing pages, in app messages, and other UI/UX elements used in experiments.
-   Data Analysts: Evaluate the data and influence the product strategy and roadmap with observations.
-   Marketers: Run user acquisition experiments, mostly focused on email campaigns, viral programs, and digital ads.
-   CSMs: Serve as first line of support for inbound support chats or emails.


### Transition growth team from “athletes” to “specialists” as the organization scales <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#transition-growth-team-from-athletes-to-specialists-as-the-organization-scales}

specialized engineers as either core product engineers dedicated to the product road map or growth engineers dedicated to the growth funnel.

### Specialize Product and Engineering as either Growth or Core Product {#specialize-product-and-engineering-as-either-growth-or-core-product}


### Report Growth into Product, not Marketing {#report-growth-into-product-not-marketing}


### Start with CSMs, Not Salespeople {#start-with-csms-not-salespeople}

This ruins the “adopt-before-buy” potential of PLG. If human-in-the-loop model is needed before adoption and monetization occurs, use a CSM profile, trained to understand the buyer needs and then show the buyer how to fulfill those needs in the product.


### Compensate Salespeople More for Expansion Revenue than New Revenue {#compensate-salespeople-more-for-expansion-revenue-than-new-revenue}


## Enable Rapid, High Quality Experimentation {#enable-rapid-high-quality-experimentation}

1.  Hold the team accountable to properly defining the experiment up front.
2.  Setup a weekly call to review the outcomes of last week’s experiments, discuss learnings, and discuss ideas for the next set of experiments.
3.  Maintain an experiment log.
4.  Balance Quick Wins with Big Bets.
5.  Invest R&amp;D in making experimentation easy across the organization.


## Strategic Considerations of PLG {#strategic-considerations-of-plg}


### The Hidden Power of PLG: Sustainable Moat Development {#the-hidden-power-of-plg-sustainable-moat-development}


### Early Focus on PLG Increases the Likelihood of Product-Market-Fit {#early-focus-on-plg-increases-the-likelihood-of-product-market-fit}


### PLG is Very Difficult to Implement After Scale {#plg-is-very-difficult-to-implement-after-scale}


## Category Attributes Favorable to PLG {#category-attributes-favorable-to-plg}

\#1: Low time and effort to retainable value
\#2: A value proposition that has current demand versus one that needs to be evangelized
\#3: Potential for virality
\#4: Large, horizontal market
