## Netflix: Lessons in Experimentation {#netflix-lessons-in-experimentation}

On the other hand, launching anything as an experiment takes more analytics and
engineering work, and typically also slows down forward progress. If you already
have a vision of the future, does it make sense to test your way there in twice
the time?

For [Netflix]({{<relref "20220316163546-netflix.md#" >}}), the answer has been ‘yes’ for nearly its entire quarter-century
history.

How does Netflix manage all the tradeoffs of experiments?


### The Story {#the-story}

**1997**


#### Lesson 1: Experimentation Works in the Real World as Well as Software {#lesson-1-experimentation-works-in-the-real-world-as-well-as-software}

Since the earliest days of Netflix, before it even began as a DVD mailing
company, it has had a culture of experimentation.

[Reed Hastings]({{<relref "20220316163955-reed_hastings.md#" >}}) had sold his company Pure Software for $700M and was CEO of the
new combined entity Pure Atria. with [Marc Bernays Randolph]({{<relref "20220316164115-marc_bernays_randolph.md#" >}}) began discussing the
opportunity to mail movies.

Reed saw the DVD format proliferating in Japan but had never used one himself.
So he drove to the store and got himself one. He then mailed it. To his great
surprise, it came back in great shape. It worked.

**1998**

Marc and the team went about testing out different types of packaging. Many of
the employees’ families helped test...They just shipped them back to test disk
durability in the mail.

After various iterations, the team landed on Netflix’s now-famous padded paper
sleeve. It was cheap and durable enough to give the team the confidence to
launch.

Netflix made its official debut on April 14th, 1998...does not mean users will
come.Netflix would [experiment](https://www.headspacegroup.co.uk/the-netflix-story-how-they-got-150-million-subscribers/) with hooks like free trial to nab the growing
market of DVD watchers.

**1999**


### Lesson 2: Experimentation Is Great for Business Models {#lesson-2-experimentation-is-great-for-business-models}

in 1999 was experimenting with a subscription model.

the team built out subscriptions for a small alpha group. The numbers were
promising. As a result, they made the change for everyone.

**2000**
[Movie lovers](https://www.businessmodelsinc.com/exponential-business-model/netflix/) everywhere were subscribing to the service.


### Lesson 3: Personalization Is a Great Canvas for Experimentation {#lesson-3-personalization-is-a-great-canvas-for-experimentation}

Early implementations of the Netflix system used IMDb and user rating data to
create a content-based predictor. Personalization would take the content-based
methods that had driven Netflix’s early algorithms and extend them to personal
attributes.

People were watching more movies when subscribed to Netflix, getting more joy,
and therefore recommending to friends. Netflix revenue more than 7x’d to $36M.

**2001**
Revenue 2x’d from $36M in 2000 to $76M in 2001.

**2002**
On January 4th of 2002, the [Netflix S-1](https://www.prospectus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/netflix.pdf) dropped.

Whatever the valuation, the team would continue to work on the core business
throughout this time. And the core business was [Personalization]({{<relref "20220316171631-personalization.md#" >}}).

**2003**
2003 was the year [Marc Randolph]({{<relref "20220316164115-marc_bernays_randolph.md#" >}}) left [Netflix]({{<relref "20220316163546-netflix.md#" >}}). [Reed Hastings]({{<relref "20220316163955-reed_hastings.md#" >}}) became sole CEO.

Netflix [would](http://q4live.s22.clientfiles.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/959853165/files/doc%5Ffinancials/annual%5Freports/2004AR%5Fprint.pdf) more than 2.5x its subscriber base from 1M to 2.6M over the course of the year.

**2004**
This theme of personalization as Netflix’s investor positioning would [continue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc%5Ffinancials/annual%5Freports/2005ar.pdf)
in 2004.

**2005-2006**
As Netflix began to reach scale, growth slowed. Instead of 2-3x, subscriber
growth hit 51% and 19%.

Part of this was a strategy. Netflix was preparing for the next leg of its
business: [Streaming]({{<relref "20220316172017-streaming.md#" >}}).

**2007**
Subscriber growth was a minuscule 19% for the year.
Netflix was offering a service for high-bandwidth consumers before they even had
high bandwidth.

**2008**
Eventually, users got the bandwidth, and habits changed.


### Lesson 4: People Outside Can Help {#lesson-4-people-outside-can-help}

**2009**
Reed and the team were ready to drive a broader experimentation agenda with
personalization to reduce content costs.

Their [solution](https://www.wired.com/2009/06/winning-teams-join-to-qualify-for-1-million-netflix-prize/) was the $1M Netflix Prize. Released in 2006, no team was able to
crack it for three years.

in 2009, the winning teams ended up submitting an algorithm that performed
10.05% better than the one Netflix used.
