content or tools you publish behind a form that they have to fill out to access
more helpful content.


#### 2. Engage {#2-dot-engage}

This stage is all about continuing to delight your existing customers to
improve their satisfaction, increase their loyalty, and build a word-of-mouth
engine that fuels the "Attract" phase and brings in new customers.
