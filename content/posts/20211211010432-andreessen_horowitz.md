## About {#about}

Founded in 2009 by [Marc Andreessen]({{<relref "20211211010651-marc_andreessen.md#" >}}) and [Ben Horowitz]({{<relref "20211211010800-ben_horowitz.md#" >}}), Andreessen Horowitz (known
as "a16z") is a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley, California, that backs
bold entrepreneurs building the future through technology. We are stage
agnostic: We invest in seed to late-stage technology companies, across the
consumer, enterprise, bio/healthcare, crypto, and fintech spaces. a16z has
$19.2B in assets under management across multiple funds, including the $1.4B Bio
funds, the $3.1B Crypto funds, and the Cultural Leadership Fund.

a16z is defined by respect for the entrepreneur and the entrepreneurial company
building process; we know what it’s like to be in the founder’s shoes. The firm
is led by general partners, many of whom are former founders/operators, CEOs, or
CTOs of successful technology companies, and who have domain expertise ranging
from biology to crypto to distributed systems to security to marketplaces to
financial services.
