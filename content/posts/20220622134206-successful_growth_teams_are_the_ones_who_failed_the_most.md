## Successful growth teams are the ones who failed the most! <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#successful-growth-teams-are-the-ones-who-failed-the-most}

[Growth Hacking]({{< relref "20210808182055-growth_hacking.md" >}}) here is defined as the methodology of constant experimenting and testing across the whole customer journey, aiming to unlock hidden opportunities and achieve long-term sustainable growth.


### Layers to build successful growth teams {#layers-to-build-successful-growth-teams}


#### 1) KPIs {#1-kpis}

The rationality behind such discovery is pretty straightforward: growth teams are owners of three types of KPIs that are structure in a cadence (from macro to micro):

-   First layer: North Star Metric
-   Second layer: Objectives, or One Metric That Matters
-   Third layer: Experiment or Test;


#### 2) Purpose {#2-purpose}

Each of them has a different purpose but an equally important responsibility in the trajectory of a growth team:

-   ****First layer****: the strategic level, to ensure that growth has an in (company) and out (customer) perspective of where they are heading.
-   ****Second layer****: the operational level, to ensure that the growth team is focusing on the right problem at that point in time, which is also the biggest growth/improvement opportunity;
-   ****Third layer****: the tactical level, to ensure that the growth team’s activity is deploying high-tempo and small scale tests


#### 3) Success {#3-success}

So what does a win means for each layer of the growth KPIs?

-   ****First layer****: You are growing both in terms of value perceived by your customers (who are using more your product) and by your company (who is growing in revenue, market share, etc)
-   ****Second layer****: You have reached your target (sub-metric) and found a new way to solve a problem that is scalable, repeatable, and can be deployed on a larger scale.
-   ****Third layer****: You are taking measured and control risks by running tests and experiments — always connected to the challenge above — to unlock growth opportunities;

    focus on 1 problem at the time (spend time figuring what that should be) and execute as many tests and experiments as you can (effectiveness) — if 1 out 10 experiments is validated (90% failure rate).
