## What is customer lifecycle management? {#what-is-customer-lifecycle-management}


### What is customer lifecycle management? {#what-is-customer-lifecycle-management}

[Customer lifecycle management]({{<relref "20220305091635-customer_lifecycle_management.md#" >}}) is the process of assigning metrics to each
stage of the [Customer Lifecycle]({{<relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md#" >}})  to analyze and monitor business performance. The
customer lifecycle can be thought of as an arc that builds from a customer first
learning about your company and products toward the final goal: [customer loyalty]({{<relref "20220305091800-customer_loyalty.md#" >}}).


### [Customer Lifecycle]({{<relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md#" >}}) stages {#customer-lifecycle--20210729233505-customer-lifetime-dot-md--stages}


#### [Awareness]({{<relref "20220303003159-awareness.md#" >}}) {#awareness--20220303003159-awareness-dot-md}

The customer becomes aware of you and begins the first customer journey of what
will hopefully become many. Perhaps your customer learned about your company
through a social media post, an advertisement, or a reference from a friend.


#### Consideration / [Engagement]({{<relref "20210731183111-engagement.md#" >}}) {#consideration-engagement--20210731183111-engagement-dot-md}

The next step for these potential customers is to consider a purchase. Here,
companies can help educate potential customers by creating a solid knowledge
base, by providing a chat option to answer questions, and by offering
information through blog posts, webinars, and other marketing materials in order
to ease the customer into the next step. [Customer engagement](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-engagement-actually-means/) is key here.


#### [Purchase]({{<relref "20220305090525-purchase.md#" >}}) {#purchase--20220305090525-purchase-dot-md}

Once someone has engaged with you either through creating an account or making a
purchase, they become part of your company’s [Customer Relationship Management]({{<relref "20210704214351-crm.md#" >}})
record. That valuable data can be used to inform future marketing efforts
as well as fine-tune the customer experience.


#### [Retention]({{<relref "20210731183135-retention.md#" >}}) {#retention--20210731183135-retention-dot-md}

Retention is about keeping the conversation going and using data to anticipate
what the customer might need at each lifecycle stage.


#### [Customer Loyalty]({{<relref "20220305091800-customer_loyalty.md#" >}}) / Advocacy {#customer-loyalty--20220305091800-customer-loyalty-dot-md--advocacy}

Loyalty happens when all this works well together. That’s when you have a
customer who is a brand ambassador—they will look first to you for products and
services they need that you can provide while urging friends and family to buy
from you, too.
