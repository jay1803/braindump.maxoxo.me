## Learning Theory {#learning-theory}

Learning theory describes how students receive, process, and retain knowledge
during learning. Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well
as prior experience, all play a part in how understanding, or a world view, is
acquired or changed and knowledge and skills retained.
