## Calculating LTV and CAC for a SaaS startup {#calculating-ltv-and-cac-for-a-saas-startup}


## [CAC]({{<relref "20210731174605-customer_acquisition_cost.md#" >}}) – Cost to Acquire a Customer {#cac--20210731174605-customer-acquisition-cost-dot-md--cost-to-acquire-a-customer}

\begin{equation}
CAC=\frac{Sum\ of\ all\ Sales\ &\ Marketing\ expenses}{Number\ of\ new\ customers}
\end{equation}


## [Customer Lifetime]({{<relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md#" >}}) {#customer-lifetime--20210729233505-customer-lifetime-dot-md}

\begin{equation}
{Customer\ lifetime}=\frac{1}{Customer\ churn\ rate}
\end{equation}

If churn is using monthly, then lifetime is month, if yearly, then years.


## [Customer Lifetime Value]({{<relref "20210731022109-customer_lifetime_value.md#" >}}) {#customer-lifetime-value--20210731022109-customer-lifetime-value-dot-md}


## [LTV-CAC Ratio]({{<relref "20210808183507-ltv_cac_ratio.md#" >}}) {#ltv-cac-ratio--20210808183507-ltv-cac-ratio-dot-md}


## [Months to Recover CAC]({{<relref "20210808183656-months_to_recover_cac.md#" >}}) {#months-to-recover-cac--20210808183656-months-to-recover-cac-dot-md}

\begin{equation}
{Months\ to \recover\ CAC}=\frac{CAC}{ARPU}
\end{equation}

To be perfectly accurate, this should include a Gross Margin adjustment as
follows:

\begin{equation}
{Months\ to \recover\ CAC}=\frac{CAC}{{ARPU}\times{Gross\ Margin\ \%}}
\end{equation}


## Sales Efficiency {#sales-efficiency}

\begin{equation}
{Gross\ sales\ efficiency}=\frac{Gross\ new\ ARR\ booked\ in\ current\ quarter}{Total\ sales\ & \marketing\ expenses\ in\ the\ prior\ quarter}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{Net\ sales\ efficiency}=\frac{Net\ new\ ARR\ booked\ in\ the\ current\ quarter}{Total\ sales\ & \ marketing\ expenses\ in\ the\ current\ quarter}
\end{equation}


### The Relationship between Sales Efficiency and Months to recover CAC {#the-relationship-between-sales-efficiency-and-months-to-recover-cac}


## Magic Number {#magic-number}

\begin{equation}
{Magic\ number}=\frac{({{GAAP\ Revenue\ this\ quarter}-{GAAP\ Revenue\ in\ the\ prior\ quarter}})\times{4}}{Sales\ and\ marketing\ expense\ in\ the\ prior\ quarter}
\end{equation}

There are two shortcomings of the Magic Number that are worth knowing:

1.  It does not take into consideration Gross Margin %. We have already pointed
    out that if you have low gross margins, you really need to have much higher
    sales efficiencies to make up for that.
2.  It does not take into consideration the mix between Subscription Revenue
    and Services Revenue, which is far less valuable, and typically lower
    margin.
