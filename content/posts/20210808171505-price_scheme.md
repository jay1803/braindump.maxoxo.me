## Definition {#definition}

A Pricing Scheme enables you to set a range of standard prices for a product
in addition to the default price. This allows you to create special pricing
for:

-   Specific customers.
-   Customers originating from particular marketing campaigns.
-   Specific volumes of goods/services.
-   Different currencies.
