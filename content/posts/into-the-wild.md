## Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past. ― Jon Krakauer {#some-people-feel-like-they-don-t-deserve-love-dot-they-walk-away-quietly-into-empty-spaces-trying-to-close-the-gaps-of-the-past-dot-jon-krakauer}


## 你只有相信自己所做的是伟大的工作，你才能怡然自得。如果你现在还没有找到，那么继续找、不要停下来、全心全意的去找，当你找到的时候你就会知道的。 {#你只有相信自己所做的是伟大的工作-你才能怡然自得-如果你现在还没有找到-那么继续找-不要停下来-全心全意的去找-当你找到的时候你就会知道的}


## And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. {#and-the-only-way-to-do-great-work-is-to-love-what-you-do-dot-if-you-haven-t-found-it-yet-keep-looking-dot-don-t-settle-dot-as-with-all-matters-of-the-heart-you-ll-know-when-you-find-it-dot}


## Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. {#again-you-can-t-connect-the-dots-looking-forward-you-can-only-connect-them-looking-backward-dot-so-you-have-to-trust-that-the-dots-will-somehow-connect-in-your-future-dot}

There is a pleasure in the pathless woods
There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar:
I love not man the less, but Nature more,
From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.
-- Lord Byron, (1788-1824)
无径之林，常有情趣
无人之岸，几多惊喜
岸畔崖间，鼓涛为乐
无人驻足，是为桃源
吾爱世人，自然甚之


## It should not be denied that being footloose has always exhilarated us. It is associated in our minds with escape from history and oppression and law and irksome obligations. Absolute freedom. And the road has always led west. {#it-should-not-be-denied-that-being-footloose-has-always-exhilarated-us-dot-it-is-associated-in-our-minds-with-escape-from-history-and-oppression-and-law-and-irksome-obligations-dot-absolute-freedom-dot-and-the-road-has-always-led-west-dot}

不可否认，无疆行走总是让人振奋。在我们心中，它意味着忘记过去，摆脱压力，逃离法律与繁琐义务。绝对的自由，还有道路一直会向西延伸。


## the sea's only gifts are harsh blows, and, occasionally, the chance to feel strong. now, I don't know much about the sea, but I do know that that's the way it is here. and I also know how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong, but to feel strong, to measure yourself at least once, to find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions, facing the blind, deaf stone alone with nothing to help you but your hands and your own head. {#the-sea-s-only-gifts-are-harsh-blows-and-occasionally-the-chance-to-feel-strong-dot-now-i-don-t-know-much-about-the-sea-but-i-do-know-that-that-s-the-way-it-is-here-dot-and-i-also-know-how-important-it-is-in-life-not-necessarily-to-be-strong-but-to-feel-strong-to-measure-yourself-at-least-once-to-find-yourself-at-least-once-in-the-most-ancient-of-human-conditions-facing-the-blind-deaf-stone-alone-with-nothing-to-help-you-but-your-hands-and-your-own-head-dot}

大海唯一可以给我们的就是无情的海浪，有时候，海浪会来得很猛烈。现在，我对大海知之甚少，但我知道这就是它所存在的方式。我还知道，活着是多么的重要，不必真的很强壮，却要觉得自己强壮 。哪怕只有一次，也要去证明自己，哪怕只有一次，也要最原生态中去发现自我，独自一人面对冰冷的石头，只靠你的双手和大脑。


## Rather than love, than money, than faith, than fame, than fairness, give me the truth. {#rather-than-love-than-money-than-faith-than-fame-than-fairness-give-me-the-truth-dot}

我宁可不要爱情、金钱、信仰、名誉、公平，给我真相。 ——梭罗
