\#+BEGIN\_QUOTE
This book just under 10 hours of enduring the most annoying voice to explain a theory that could have been covered more effectively in ten minutes. They covered every piece of scientific data since the dawn of man that lead to their achievement. This lead to their argument being broken and lost in the vast amount of data they presented to cover up the fact that their ground breaking theory amounted to little more than what every middle school child understands about human nature. People want to acquire stuff, friends, knowledge, and then protect it once they have it. The specific way go about this is defined by the prevailing social norms in their area. I guess it doesn't even take 10 minutes to explain.  #+END\_QUOTE
