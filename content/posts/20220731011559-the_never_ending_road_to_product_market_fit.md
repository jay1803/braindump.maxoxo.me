## Overview <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#overview}

Instead of thinking about [product/market fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}) as a definitive point on the startup path, I think about it as a series of tests and check points that increase in difficulty, but also in definitiveness.

## 1.  The Leading Indicator Survey {#1-dot-the-leading-indicator-survey}


### 1a.  [Product/Market Fit Survey]({{< relref "20221212175353-how_to_measure_product_market_fit_with_survey_io.md" >}}) {#1a-dot-product-market-fit-survey--20221212175353-how-to-measure-product-market-fit-with-survey-io-dot-md}

“How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?”  The measure of success is if 40% or more respond “Very Disappointed.”


### 1b.  NPS (Net Promoter Score) {#1b-dot-nps--net-promoter-score}


## 2.  Leading Indicator Engagement Data {#2-dot-leading-indicator-engagement-data}

The leading indicator survey data tells you what people say they would do (i.e. be very disappointed if the product disappeared) so the next step is to support that with data about what they are actually doing.

This data must align with:

1.  Events or actions, not views
2.  The core purpose of the product


## 3.  The Retention Curve {#3-dot-the-retention-curve}

Then there a number of custom segments you will want to do depending on what type of business/product you have.


## 4.  The Trifecta {#4-dot-the-trifecta}

Snapchat had the trifecta.

1.  Non-Trivial Top Line Growth(Snapchat - 200K downloads)
2.  Retention (50% of downloads were active Daily)
3.  Meaningful Usage (The users just weren’t coming back daily, but there were taking a meaningful action - sending 10 pictures a day on average)


## It Never Ends {#it-never-ends}

This process never ends primarily for one reason -  your market doesn’t sit still.

As your market moves, your product needs to move with it making [product/market fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}) a pulse that you need to constantly keep your thumb on.


## Volume Of Data and Users <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#volume-of-data-and-users}

As you progress through these checkpoints the volume of users and data needed increases.  As Rob Go of NextView Ventures points out, it is not an either or answer between PMF or Growth.  It is a progressing balance of each.
