## Definition {#definition}

is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a
future state for the series of events that take a product or service from the
beginning of the specific process until it reaches the customer. A value
stream map is a visual tool that displays all critical steps in a specific
process and quantifies easily the time and volume taken at each stage.[2]
Value stream maps show the flow of both materials and information as they
progress through the process.
