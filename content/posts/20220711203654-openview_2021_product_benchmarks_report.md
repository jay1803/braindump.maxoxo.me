## Key Product-Led Metrics {#key-product-led-metrics}

-   [Activation]({{< relref "20210906161249-activation.md" >}}): Activation is the moment when your product delivers on the value that is promised. Sometimes referred to as the [Aha Moment]({{< relref "20211104132111-aha_moment.md" >}}), it's when someone understands why they would use a product.
    e.g. Typeform qualifies their activation metric as five unique response to a Typeform.
-   [PQL]({{< relref "20210924095503-product_qualified_lead.md" >}}): Free users who meet a threshold of significant actions token to qualify for sales outreach.
    e.g. For an OpenView portfolio company, spending &gt;30 min in the application in your first or second visit makes you a PQL.

[Activation Rate]({{< relref "20210906161249-activation.md#activation-rate" >}}) benchmarks: average around 33%.

[PQL]({{< relref "20210924095503-product_qualified_lead.md" >}}) adoption isn't growing:

-   because of remote work in 2020.
-   lack of experienced talent.
-   PQLs don't typically result in an impact on top-lin revenue for a quarter or so.
