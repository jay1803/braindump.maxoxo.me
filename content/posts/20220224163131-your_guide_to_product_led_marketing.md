There are two flavors of templates:

-   Programmatic templates: For example, “How to do X+Y” pages. Not much content
    is needed—just enough to convey value and the context of how you help a user
    achieve their goal.
-   Bespoke templates: You actually create your own templates along with content
    around them.
