We study the statistics of human deaths from wars, conflicts, similar man-made
conflicts as well as natural disasters. The probability distribution of number
of people killed in natural disasters as well as man made situations show
power law decay for the largest sizes, with similar exponent values.
Comparisons with natural disasters, when event sizes are measured in terms of
physical quantities (e.g., energy released in earthquake, volume of rainfall,
land area affected in forest fires, etc.) also show striking resemblances. The
universal patterns in their statistics suggest that some subtle similarities
in their mechanisms and dynamics might be responsible.

Notes: the number of people dies in war are match [Zipf's Law]({{<relref "20210629132126-zipf_s_law.md#" >}}).
