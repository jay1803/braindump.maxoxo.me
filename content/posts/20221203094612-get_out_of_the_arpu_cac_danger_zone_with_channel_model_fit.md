two types of companies:

-   Tugboats, where growth feels like you have to put a ton of fuel in to get only a little speed out,
-   and Smooth Sailors, where growth feels like wind is at your back.

Channel Model Fit is simple - channels are determined by your model.

The two most important elements of your model are:

1.  How Your Charge - For example, free (monetized with ads), freemium, transactional, free trial, one year up front, etc.
2.  Average Annual Revenue Per User - What the average $$ you make from a customer/user per year.


## The ARPU &lt;-&gt; CAC Spectrum <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#the-arpu-cac-spectrum}

On far left you have businesses that have low [ARPU]({{< relref "20210729003208-average_revenue_per_account.md" >}}) and as a result have to use low [CAC]({{< relref "20210731174605-customer_acquisition_cost.md" >}}) channels to drive customers.
On the far right you have businesses that have high ARPU and as a result are able to use high CAC channels.

## Implications Of Channel Model Fit {#implications-of-channel-model-fit}

two primary implications of [Channel Model Fit]({{< relref "20210828150815-channel_model_fit.md" >}}):

1.  Don't Treat Model and Channel In Silos: f you are making changes to your model (pricing, how you charge, etc.), you also need to consider your channel to make sure you still have Channel Model Fit.
