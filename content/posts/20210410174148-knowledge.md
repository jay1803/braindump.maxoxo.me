## DEFINATION {#defination}

Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or
something, such as facts (descriptive knowledge), skills (procedural
knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). By most accounts, knowledge
can be acquired in many different ways and from many sources, including but
not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry,
education, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called
epistemology.
