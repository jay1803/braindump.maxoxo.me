## Overview {#overview}

[PMF]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}) It’s not a clear metric you can measure or a milestone you can easily check off your to-do list.
I think of product-market fit as the transition moment you feel as a founder when you go from "pushing" your product on people to them "pulling" it out of your hands.


## EXPLORING IDEAS AND VALIDATING THE VISION: <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#exploring-ideas-and-validating-the-vision}

The early vision was to democratize software creation

Brush up on the prior art: “We were intellectually excited about going down that path of this general space of software creation. So we spent a lot of time doing research. It was almost like being on a sabbatical, reading all this prior art of old computing pioneers, like Douglas Engelbart and Bill Atkinson, and even contemporaries, like Bret Victor. We played with old products, like HyperCard, that had flavors of software creation for everybody, and read a lot about how to visualize complex systems.”

We spent a lot of time thinking about ‘What is the market for this?’ Spreadsheets have been around forever, but most of the time, people use them to track objects: people, companies, simple tables.

“The first version was trying to prove that we can make a database easy to use. It was like a prototype — a lot of smoke and mirrors. We focused 100% on the UI and the interactions. We didn't really have a backend, it was just persisting to local storage and the browser — enough to make sure we could test the interactions and get to a point where people could play with it. We wanted to put it in front of people and ask them to try to organize something and see if they could actually do it,” says Ofstad.

Despite these initial hurdles, there was still an early adopter crowd. “They were programmers or database people

We were focused on de-risking the main risk for the company as early as possible.


## Alpha: Stay lean while you de-risk your biggest hurdle. {#alpha-stay-lean-while-you-de-risk-your-biggest-hurdle-dot}

Very early on, we had a private alpha. It was invite-only, but you could refer other people, so that helped us get some organic growth, but not a ton,” says Ofstad.

In addition to delaying a public launch, this strategy also kept the team comparatively lean

If you’re building a similar type of product, Ofstad’s advice is to keep the feedback loop extremely tight and loosen your expectations around what your MVP “should” look like.


## Beta: Test, test, test — but push to go faster. {#beta-test-test-test-but-push-to-go-faster-dot}


## FIGURING OUT GO-TO-MARKET AND ASSESSING THE COMPETITION: {#figuring-out-go-to-market-and-assessing-the-competition}


### 1. Double down on early traction (carefully). {#1-dot-double-down-on-early-traction--carefully--dot}

“When you’re building a horizontal product, as soon as possible, understand where people are getting value from your product and really double down. You can build a horizontal product with a deep customer understanding of a specific use case. It's just a matter of not going too deep on it,” he says.


### 2. Blend the functional and the aspirational. {#2-dot-blend-the-functional-and-the-aspirational-dot}

One of the biggest hurdles with a horizontal product was messaging. “Over the years, we've gotten more and more focused on how we describe the problems we solve and the use cases we're good for. But before we had product-market fit, it was hard to describe the product in the early days,” says Ofstad.


### 3. Map out your adoption. {#3-dot-map-out-your-adoption-dot}

“It happened in a lot of different S-curves. We started seeing media companies where we spread word-of-mouth. Or the head of production would go from Netflix to some other company and they'd bring the tool with them. It was very slow, and wasn’t until 2018 or so that it started to really inflect,” he says.


### 4. Think about pricing as positioning early on. {#4-dot-think-about-pricing-as-positioning-early-on-dot}

“We thought about pricing from the earliest days. Even during our alpha with our first pockets of users, we had a pricing page with a few different plans. It mostly described features we hadn't built yet, but we at least wanted to frame that this is a product we're going to charge for,” says Ofstad.

“The thing we didn't build for quite a while was the actual billing system to charge our customers. We actually had a place, buried in one of our settings pages, where customers could voluntarily put their credit card in, but we didn't charge them.


### 5. Keep your head pointed forward when it comes to the competition: {#5-dot-keep-your-head-pointed-forward-when-it-comes-to-the-competition}
