## Your Guide to [PLG]({{< relref "20210924095204-product_lead_growth.md" >}}) and Community—It’s Way More Than Launching a Slack Group <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#your-guide-to-plg--20210924095204-product-lead-growth-dot-md--and-community-it-s-way-more-than-launching-a-slack-group}

Community is a win-win on so many levels:

-   Marketing
-   Product
-   Customer Success
-   Finance

### 1. Amplify community creators {#1-dot-amplify-community-creators}

Notion, the team workspace now valued at an eye-popping $10 billion, makes a
great case study.

Their community efforts include:

-   Building out the template gallery on Notion’s website (pro-tip: these are great for top-of-funnel SEO).
-   Starting an ambassador program to connect superfans with the company and each other.
-   Encouraging the community to create their own spaces to connect and learn from each other. Notion’s community-run groups (all started by ambassadors) reach hundreds of thousands of users (ex: Notion Vietnam has 200k members).
-   Sponsoring social media influencers who have large followings on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok and are keen to share what they’ve made.


### 2. Connect users with their peers {#2-dot-connect-users-with-their-peers}

Playing the role of connector helps existing users become more successful and
helps attract prospective users who want to replicate this success.


### 3. Be active within existing communities {#3-dot-be-active-within-existing-communities}

First and foremost, Klaviyo has made significant investments into its presence
on Shopify’s app store, generating nearly 1,500 reviews and making it free to
install for a Shopify merchant’s first 250 contacts. They’ve also invested in an
extremely detailed help center and content around connecting Shopify and
Klaviyo. Meanwhile, Klaviyo has partnered with Shopify influencers to promote
how to use the products together (one YouTube video alone has generated over
53,000 views). It’s no surprise that the company was extremely well-positioned
when Shopify removed Mailchimp’s integration from its marketplace in 2019,
leaving many Shopify merchants eager for a new solution.


### 4. Build a content community {#4-dot-build-a-content-community}

Another underrated community strategy: technical content.

[DigitalOcean]({{< relref "20220224211317-digitalocean.md" >}}), the developer cloud company valued at over $6 billion, has built
one of my favorite content communities and has attracted over 1 million
developers in the process.


### 5. Acquire an established community {#5-dot-acquire-an-established-community}
