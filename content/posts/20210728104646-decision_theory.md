## DEFINITION {#definition}

Decision theory (or the theory of choice not to be confused with choice
theory) is the study of an agent's choices.

Decision theory can be broken into two branches: normative decision theory,
which analyzes the outcomes of decisions or determines the optimal decisions
given constraints and assumptions, and descriptive decision theory, which
analyzes how agents actually make the decisions they do.v
