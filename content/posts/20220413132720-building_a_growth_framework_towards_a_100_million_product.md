## Building a Growth Framework Towards a $100 Million Product <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#building-a-growth-framework-towards-a-100-million-product}

Four Fits framework:

-   [Product-Market Fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}): how to lay out your Market and Product hypotheses, and how understanding whether you have Market Product Fit comes down to Qualitative, Quantitative, and Intuitive indicators.
-   [Product-Channel Fit]({{< relref "20210828150724-product_channel_fit.md" >}}): the concept that products are built to fit channels, channels are not built to fit products.
-   [Channel-Model Fit]({{< relref "20210828150815-channel_model_fit.md" >}}): which explains how channels are determined by your model. I went through the ARPU ↔ CAC spectrum and how your product and product tiers need to align on this spectrum.
-   [Model-Market Fit]({{< relref "20210828150834-model_market_fit.md" >}}): how your model influences the target market and vice versa.

### Phase One: The Beginning - Market Product Fit <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#phase-one-the-beginning-market-product-fit}

[The road to $100M doesn't start with product](https://www.coelevate.com/essays/market-product-fit) You are starting with the solution, and then trying to fit it to the problem.

During my first two weeks at [HubSpot]({{< relref "20220110110120-hubspot.md" >}}), We built out detailed [Persona]({{< relref "20210822033315-persona.md" >}}), but the four main things we defined were:

-   ****Category****. What category of products does the customer put you in?
-   ****Who****. Who is the target audience within the category? There are always multiple personas within a single category, so this breaks it down further.
-   ****Problems****. What problems does your target audience have related to the category?
-   ****Motivations****. What are the motivations behind those problems? Why are those problems important to your target audience?

[HubSpot]({{< relref "20220110110120-hubspot.md" >}}) Sales looked like this:

-   Category. Sales Software.
-   Who. The individual contributor. There were also two sub-types of ICs: SDRs and Account Reps.
-   Problem. Not knowing where a prospect or client stood in the process.
-   Motivation. A couple of motivations: 1) Money. Knowing where a prospect was led to better prioritization and selling, which led to more closing. 2) Uncertainty. The target audience's life was filled with constant uncertainty. Relieving that uncertainty was a big deal.

Our Market Product Fit Hypotheses looked like this:

At this point our four fits canvas looked something similar to this:

### Phase Two: Finding Product &lt;&gt; Channel Fit and Channel &lt;&gt; Model Fit {#phase-two-finding-product-channel-fit-and-channel-model-fit}

[Product Channel Fit will make or break your growth](https://www.brianbalfour.com/essays/product-channel-fit-for-growth). [Product-Market Fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}) states that:
“Products are built to fit with channels. Channels do not mold to products. The reason for this is that you do not define the rules of the channel. You define your product, but the channel defines the rules of the channel. “
