### What is artificial intelligence? {#what-is-artificial-intelligence}

The term “[artificial intelligence]({{< relref "20230410134835-artificial_intelligence.md" >}})” gets tossed around a lot to describe robots, self-driving cars, facial recognition technology and almost anything else that seems vaguely futuristic.

[neural network]({{< relref "20230508153644-neural_network.md" >}}) ... a mathematical system that learns skills by finding statistical patterns in enormous amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat. Neural networks enable Siri and Alexa to understand what you’re saying, identify people and objects in Google Photos and instantly translate dozens of languages.

[large language models]({{< relref "20230410135424-large_language_models.md" >}}). Around 2018, companies like [Google]({{< relref "20220129140242-google.md" >}}), [Microsoft]({{< relref "20220117204930-microsoft.md" >}}) and [OpenAI]({{< relref "20230327162227-openai.md" >}}) began building [neural networks]({{< relref "20230508153644-neural_network.md" >}}) that were trained on vast amounts of text from the internet, including Wikipedia articles, digital books and academic papers.

these systems learned to write unique prose and computer code and carry on sophisticated conversations. This is sometimes called [generative A.I.]({{< relref "20230508153924-generative_a_i.md" >}})


### Glossary {#glossary}

-   [Neural network]({{< relref "20230508153644-neural_network.md" >}}): A mathematical system, modeled on the human brain, that learns skills by finding statistical patterns in data. It consists of layers of artificial neurons: The first layer receives the input data, and the last layer outputs the results. Even the experts who create neural networks don’t always understand what happens in between.

-   [Large language model]({{< relref "20230410135424-large_language_models.md" >}}): A type of [neural network]({{< relref "20230508153644-neural_network.md" >}}) that learns skills — including generating prose, conducting conversations and writing computer code — by analyzing vast amounts of text from across the internet. The basic function is to predict the next word in a sequence, but these models have surprised experts by learning new abilities.

-   [Generative A.I.]({{< relref "20230508153924-generative_a_i.md" >}}): Technology that creates content — including text, images, video and computer code — by identifying patterns in large quantities of training data, and then creating new, original material that has similar characteristics. Examples include [ChatGPT]({{< relref "20230410135201-chatgpt.md" >}}) for text and DALL-E and [Midjourney]({{< relref "20230508154345-midjourney.md" >}}) for images.
