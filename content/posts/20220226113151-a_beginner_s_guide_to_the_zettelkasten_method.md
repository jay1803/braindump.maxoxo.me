    [Literature Notes]({{<relref "20210719214559-zettelkasten.md#definition" >}})

    context to other sourced information such as books, videos, or other available
    data.

    Permanent notes can be made as a recap or summary of the information just
    researched or learned, but can also be thoughts that popped into your brain
    while thinking over a myriad of information or while analysing any given
    context.

    they affect your interests, thinking, and research. You then cherry pick the
    notes that add value to your existing ideas and connect the new information to
    what you already know and have saved in your database.
