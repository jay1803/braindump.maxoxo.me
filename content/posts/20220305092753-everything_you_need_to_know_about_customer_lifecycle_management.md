## Everything You Need to Know about Customer Lifecycle Management {#everything-you-need-to-know-about-customer-lifecycle-management}

The best companies build mutually beneficial relationships with customers that
equate to a higher [Customer Lifetime Value]({{<relref "20210731022109-customer_lifetime_value.md#" >}}) — in other words, they ensure that
their customers are going to stick around for a while.


### What is the [Customer Lifecycle]({{<relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md#" >}})? {#what-is-the-customer-lifecycle--20210729233505-customer-lifetime-dot-md}

The customer lifecycle refers to the process of prospects becoming aware of a
product, making a purchase from a brand, and ideally becoming a company's
longtime customer. The process is made up of five stages: reach, acquisition,
conversion, retention, and loyalty.


### What is [Customer Lifecycle Management]({{<relref "20220305091635-customer_lifecycle_management.md#" >}})? {#what-is-customer-lifecycle-management--20220305091635-customer-lifecycle-management-dot-md}

Customer lifecycle management is the process of tracking the stages of the
customer lifecycle, assigning metrics to each one, and measuring success based
on those metrics. The goal is to track the business' performance over time as it
relates to the customer lifecycle.


### Customer Lifecycle Stages {#customer-lifecycle-stages}


#### 1. Reach / [Awareness]({{<relref "20220303003159-awareness.md#" >}}) {#1-dot-reach-awareness--20220303003159-awareness-dot-md}

In this stage, a customer searches for a product after becoming aware of an
issue or problem they need to solve. This stage is called “reach” because it's
your chance to reach the customer while they're deliberating.


#### 2. [Acquisition]({{<relref "20210906161214-acquisition.md#" >}}) {#2-dot-acquisition--20210906161214-acquisition-dot-md}

When the customer gets to your website or calls you on the phone, they've
officially entered the acquisition stage.


#### 3. [Conversion]({{<relref "20220305090504-conversion.md#" >}}) {#3-dot-conversion--20220305090504-conversion-dot-md}

Having gained all the necessary information and being delighted with your
brand's customer experience, the prospect makes a purchase. They've officially
converted and turned into your customer.


#### 4. [Retention]({{<relref "20210731183135-retention.md#" >}}) {#4-dot-retention--20210731183135-retention-dot-md}


#### 5. [Customer Loyalty]({{<relref "20220305091800-customer_loyalty.md#" >}}) {#5-dot-customer-loyalty--20220305091800-customer-loyalty-dot-md}
