## Defining Growth {#defining-growth}

[Hila Qu]({{< relref "20221110202205-hila_qu.md" >}})
she focused on two specific elements: goals and where the growth function lives within an organization.

B2C businesses, she says, focus primarily on user growth—mostly active users,
B2B growth, on the other hand, tends to focus more on revenue—ARR

Within a B2C organization, growth is usually pretty closely aligned with the marketing team.
In a B2B company, growth is applied much more broadly, taking a cross-functional, multidisciplinary approach that includes sales, marketing, customer success, product, and others.

These key differences between how B2C and B2B companies view and manage growth are driven by and influence growth’s relation to various parts of their respective customer journeys.


## Acquisition {#acquisition}

B2C funnel is very direct and short.
The B2B funnel, on the other hand, is built around a much longer sales cycle that can take months or even years, and which involves all the various stages of consideration, evaluation, negotiation, and so on.

The channels that drive traffic to these funnels are also different. B2C relies heavily on paid channels combined with some referral and some organic. The strategy is to cast as wide a net as possible to catch as many “fish” as possible, and drive the number of users up. In contrast, B2B leans more toward slow-and-steady channels that help build relationships and community over time. This includes channels like content, conference, and webinars—all of which tend to require a lot of up-front work, but pay off over the long term.

B2B companies often have two different funnels—one more traditional sales-led funnel, and a product-led funnel.


## Activation {#activation}

“One of the first things I learned from Sean was that if you have ten developers on your team, put five on new product and the other five on new-user activation,” she says. “Because whatever cool features you’ve built won’t matter if your activation doesn’t work.”

Hila looks at activation as a set of tiers:

-   User-level Aha
-   Team-level Aha
-   Organization-level Aha


## Conversion {#conversion}

One skill that B2B companies should learn from B2C companies is the ability to connect the dots with data in order to uncover upsell opportunities. “A lot of companies I talk with do a great job of monitoring the different teams within a company that are using their product,” Hila says.

Another area that Hila thinks is one of the most undervalued and underutilized growth levers—both for B2C and B2B—is monetization and pricing strategies.


## Retention &amp; Expansion {#retention-and-expansion}

For B2C, the focus is on removing friction so users can experience value as quickly and easily as possible. And it’s about doing a lot of experiments to improve engagement.

B2B companies can also aid retention in other ways. They can, for instance, pay close attention to usage data to get a realistic sense of which features users are actually using.
