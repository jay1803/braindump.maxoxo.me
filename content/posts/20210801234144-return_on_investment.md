## Definition {#definition}

Return on investment is a ratio between net profit (over a
period) and cost of investment (resulting from an investment of some resources
at a point in time). A high ROI means the investment's gains compare favorably
to its cost. As a performance measure, ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency
of an investment or to compare the efficiencies of several different
investments. In economic terms, it is one way of relating profit to capital
invested.
