My point is not to replace your winning sales team building relationships and selling to executives, but to equip that sales team to operate on a [PLG]({{< relref "20220707205151-product_led_growth.md" >}}) backbone that scales growth.

## PLG from an enterprise software perspective <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#plg-from-an-enterprise-software-perspective}

What does [PLG]({{< relref "20220707205151-product_led_growth.md" >}}) mean from an enterprise software perspective? It means the product not only extends vertically, but also horizontally.

![](/ox-hugo/_20220721_005740screenshot.png)
The vertical product extension is your current sales strategy to capture more and more of your customer’s value chain, with a land &amp; expand model.
The horizontal product extension is the new self-serve component of your product strategy which we call the „PLG backbone“
The PLG backbone delivers the end-to-end onboarding, using, buying and expanding capability of your product.

Four reasons why enterprise software vendors should add a PLG backbone

-   Win the POC experience
-   Entry-level protection
    today, approximately 50% of enterprise users already want to try products first and then make recommendations to their managers (buyer), without talking to the vendor. (source?)
-   Scaleable sales &amp; service
-   Lower CAC, higher gross profit &amp; NRR
