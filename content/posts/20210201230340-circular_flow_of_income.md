## Circular Flow of Income {#circular-flow-of-income}

The circular flow of income or circular flow is a model of the economy in
which the major exchanges are represented as flows of money, goods and
services, etc. between economic agents. The flows of money and goods exchanged
in a closed circuit correspond in value, but run in the opposite direction.
The circular flow analysis is the basis of national accounts and hence of
macroeconomics.
