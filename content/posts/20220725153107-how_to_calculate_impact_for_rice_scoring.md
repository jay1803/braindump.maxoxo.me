> Intercom's [original guide](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/) to RICE Scoring says this pretty clearly: "Choosing an impact number may seem unscientific. But remember the alternative: a tangled mess of gut feeling."

Here's how you can accurately measure impact for [RICE]({{< relref "20211102135254-ice_framework.md" >}}) Scoring in just 8 steps:


## Step 1: Define Your Objective {#step-1-define-your-objective}

For the purpose of this guide, let's focus on 'removing friction from the end-user experience' as our impact objective.


## Step 2: Identify Your Customer Segment {#step-2-identify-your-customer-segment}

you must identify which segment will move the needle most.

At this stage, we need not necessarily exclude customers that fall outside our target segment.

For this example, we're going to focus on revenue as our segmentation category, meaning we plan to split our results into freemium, premium and enterprise customers.


## Step 3: Stack Ranking {#step-3-stack-ranking}

stack ranking uses a combination of data science techniques (pairwise comparison voting, rating system algorithms, and weighted option distribution) to compare a list of options under a core question and rank them from highest to lowest.


## Step 4: Question Time {#step-4-question-time}

turn our objective into a question for our customers.


## Step 5: Import Your Options {#step-5-import-your-options}


## Step 6: Engage Participants {#step-6-engage-participants}


## Step 7: Converting Results to Impact {#step-7-converting-results-to-impact}


## Step 8: Time to Experiment {#step-8-time-to-experiment}
