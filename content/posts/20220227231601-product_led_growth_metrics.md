### The [Product-Led Growth Flywheel]({{<relref "20220227223049-product_led_growth_flywheel.md#" >}}) {#the-product-led-growth-flywheel--20220227223049-product-led-growth-flywheel-dot-md}


### Revisiting the [Pirate Metrics]({{<relref "20211029121906-pirate_metrics.md#" >}}) framework {#revisiting-the-pirate-metrics--20211029121906-pirate-metrics-dot-md--framework}

In our framework, the pirate metrics are:

-   [Acquisition]({{<relref "20210906161214-acquisition.md#" >}}): the number of users who sign up for your free trial or freemium
    plan
-   [Activation]({{<relref "20210906161249-activation.md#" >}}): expressed as the percent of users who have achieved value, out of
    total acquired users
-   [Revenue]({{<relref "20210822025209-revenue.md#" >}}): can be measured by average contract value (ACV), monthly recurring
    revenue (MRR), average revenue per user (ARPU), etc.
-   [Retention]({{<relref "20210731183135-retention.md#" >}}): the number of users who continue using or paying for your product
    (typically month over month)
-   [Referral]({{<relref "20210906161335-referral.md#" >}}): the percentage of current users who successfully recruit new users
    to your product


### How to measure product-led growth {#how-to-measure-product-led-growth}


#### [Time to value](#orga020dae) {#}

<a id="orga020dae">Time to value</a> [Time-to-Value]({{<relref "20220227223812-time_to_value.md#" >}})
[Time to value](#orga020dae) (TTV) is the amount of time it takes new users to reach their
first aha moment or activation event.
[Time to value](#orga020dae) can be further broken down into immediate (or short) [time to
value](#orga020dae), and [long time to value](#org098acfb).

-   <a id="orgfc03de6">Immediate or short time to value</a>: If it’s raining and you duck into a nearby
    store to buy an umbrella, the [time to value](#orga020dae) is immediate—you’re no longer
    getting soaked and can see the value of the umbrella straight away.
-   <a id="org098acfb">Long time to value</a>: Many SaaS products fall into this category. Buying or
    signing up for your product doesn’t automatically provide value—some further
    action is required.


#### [Product-qualified leads](#orgf61b5d6) {#}

<a id="orgf61b5d6">Product-qualified leads</a> [Product Qualified Lead]({{<relref "20210924095503-product_qualified_lead.md#" >}})
are typically activated users—folks who have completed a key action within your
product, had their aha moment, and have seen the value that your product can
offer first-hand.

To find your product’s activation event and define what a PQL looks like at your
company, you’ll want to use a combination of user interviews, session
recordings, and A/B tests to identify the user behaviors that correlate with
conversion and retention.


#### [Expansion MRR]({{<relref "20210807103653-monthly_recurring_revenue.md#net-mrr" >}}) {#expansion-mrr--20210807103653-monthly-recurring-revenue-dot-md}

It’s roughly 2X cheaper to upsell to an existing customer than it is to acquire
a new one—and over 3X cheaper to generate expansion revenue than new customer
CAC.


#### [Average Revenuen Per User]({{<relref "20210729003208-average_revenue_per_account.md#" >}}) {#average-revenuen-per-user--20210729003208-average-revenue-per-account-dot-md}


#### [Customer Lifetime Value]({{<relref "20210731022109-customer_lifetime_value.md#" >}}) {#customer-lifetime-value--20210731022109-customer-lifetime-value-dot-md}


#### [Net MRR Churn Rate]({{<relref "20210803120415-churn.md#churn-rate" >}}) {#net-mrr-churn-rate--20210803120415-churn-dot-md}


#### [Virality]({{<relref "20211103203550-viral_loop.md#" >}}) and [Network Effect]({{<relref "20210313214856-network_effect.md#" >}}) {#virality--20211103203550-viral-loop-dot-md--and-network-effect--20210313214856-network-effect-dot-md}
