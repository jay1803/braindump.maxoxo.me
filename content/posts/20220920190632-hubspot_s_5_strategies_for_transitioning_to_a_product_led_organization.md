About six years ago, we noticed a dramatic shift happening in the world of buying and selling: companies that were going to market as “product first,” customer experience-focused entities were outpacing large incumbents that were over-reliant on high touch, high friction sales models.


## 1. The Transition to PLG from the Customer’s Point of View {#1-dot-the-transition-to-plg-from-the-customer-s-point-of-view}


## 2. Clearly Communicate with Sales and Incentivize Sales through New Comp Plans {#2-dot-clearly-communicate-with-sales-and-incentivize-sales-through-new-comp-plans}

we sent tons of product qualified leads (PQL’s) to our sales reps

When we switched to a freemium model, we readjusted our comp plans to promote a seed and growth strategy, whereby we incentivize our customers starting with a small number of users, gaining a ton of value, then adding more licenses/seats over time. This is the same model that you see at places like Slack who employ similar B2C2B strategies.


## 3. Hire Inbound Success Coaches to Complement Sales {#3-dot-hire-inbound-success-coaches-to-complement-sales}

we needed to hire entry-level Customer Success and Implementation folks who are entirely focused on customer satisfaction, providing freemium users with a human to supplement the nurturing and onboarding that our product automates.


## 4. Embrace Ruthless Segmentation to Ensure Quality Leads {#4-dot-embrace-ruthless-segmentation-to-ensure-quality-leads}

This taught us how critical it was to ruthlessly segment users/leads by creating a system that connected our best-fit prospects with our sales folks, and pushed all others towards full self-service.


## 5. Track Product-Oriented Metrics {#5-dot-track-product-oriented-metrics}


### Acquisition {#acquisition}

By tracking the number of signups or prospects who visit our website, we can determine which sources (e.g., channels) generate the highest rate of top-of-the-funnel demand for our tools at the lowest cost.


### Activation {#activation}

We monitor how many and which sign-ups convert to active users on each of our tools to improve usage.


### Monetization {#monetization}

By tracking which activations eventually become paid users, we can see which PQL’s convert the fastest with the highest ultimate value.


### Time to Value {#time-to-value}

Tracking how quickly we deliver value to customers after they sign up ensures we are minimizing this metric and that customers understand the value we’re providing.


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

In order to smooth this transition, we learned to adopt the customer’s point of view, clearly communicate with sales, hire complementary Inbound Success Coaches, segment prospects and track unique metrics. While we’re constantly iterating on our process, one thing remains the same: a dedication to our customers.
