光之所以会在水中发生折射，是因为这种下光的转播所需的时间最短，同时需要的 [Action]({{<relref "20210715132734-action.md#" >}}) 最小。

All objects in the universe behave in the same way that our light beam did.

At least that's waht [Richard Feynman]({{<relref "20210713123255-richard_feynman.md#" >}}) taught
A more philosophical interpretation dates back as far as [亚里士多德]({{<relref "20210807133211-aristotle.md#" >}}) as is that
nature does in fact have goals. Things move in such a way to satisfy nature's
goals. The [Principle of Least Action]({{<relref "20210704152024-stationary_action_principle.md#" >}}) is a manifestation of this idea.
