## A Beginner's Guide to the Customer Life Cycle {#a-beginner-s-guide-to-the-customer-life-cycle}


### Overview: What is the [Customer Lifecycle]({{<relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md#" >}})? {#overview-what-is-the-customer-lifecycle--20210729233505-customer-lifetime-dot-md}

The customer life cycle defines the various stages a consumer passes through on
the path to becoming a loyal customer. It involves the touchpoints a consumer
will have with your company from the first time they hear about you through to
an ongoing relationship with your business.

Your efforts to nurture clients through these stages allow you to grow the
[Customer Lifetime Value]({{<relref "20210731022109-customer_lifetime_value.md#" >}}), and so, it’s useful to document these stages in a
[User Journey Map]({{<relref "20211113002725-user_journey_map.md#" >}}), a visual representation of the consumer’s touchpoints
with your company.


### Stages of the customer life cycle {#stages-of-the-customer-life-cycle}


#### 1. [Awareness]({{<relref "20220303003159-awareness.md#" >}}) {#1-dot-awareness--20220303003159-awareness-dot-md}

This is the point where a consumer first becomes aware of your business
offerings.

It can also be the most expensive for your business from a cost per acquisition
perspective

-  Maximizing awareness:

    -   Collect data: When you’re building an acquisition strategy for the first time,
        you don’t know which tactics will ultimately work best to raise awareness and
        bring customers into your sales funnel.
    -   Use different tactics: Try a variety of methods to acquire customers.


#### 2. [Consideration]({{<relref "20210731183111-engagement.md#" >}}) {#2-dot-consideration--20210731183111-engagement-dot-md}

In the consideration stage, the consumer has discovered your business and is now
collecting information to weigh the pros and cons of your offerings. Sometimes,
this assessment is against your competition.

-  Maximizing consideration:

    -   Leverage a CRM
    -   Provide access to information
    -   Offer a carrot

They’ve evaluated your offerings and decided to buy from you.

-  Maximizing purchases:

    -   Collect more data: You want to collect data about the kinds of customers who make a purchase so you can find more like them to target during the earlier stages.
    -   Remove purchase barriers: Adding functionality such as chat to your website can help remove barriers for customers to make a purchase.
    -   Perform follow up: If you’re an e-commerce business, adopt e-commerce software that automatically follows up with customers who abandoned items in their digital shopping carts to remind them to complete their purchase.


#### 4. [Retention]({{<relref "20210731183135-retention.md#" >}}) {#4-dot-retention--20210731183135-retention-dot-md}

The retention phase is all about deepening the relationship with the customer after the purchase so that they are more likely to buy from you again. This happens by providing follow-ups, reminders, and promotions to customers, usually via email.

-  Maximizing retention:

    -   Hand-hold customers
    -   Provide support
    -   Personalize communication
    -   Encourage additional sales

-  Maximizing advocacy:

    -   Implement a loyalty program
    -   Create a referral program
