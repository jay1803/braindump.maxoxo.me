## Chapter 1: Welcome to the Customer Experience Era <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-1-welcome-to-the-customer-experience-era}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220701_100129screenshot.png" >}}

[a study published in the Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-value-of-customer-experience-quantified) found that customers who had the best experiences with a transaction-based business spent 140 percent more than customers who had the worst experiences.

let’s dig a bit more into the impact of digital transformation across industries.


### 1.1 Digital Transformation is Changing Everything {#1-dot-1-digital-transformation-is-changing-everything}

Between 2000 and 2014, 52 percent of Fortune 500 companies disappeared, either by going bankrupt or through acquisition.


#### Retail Books: Borders vs. Amazon {#retail-books-borders-vs-dot-amazon}


#### Movie Rentals: Blockbuster vs. Netflix {#movie-rentals-blockbuster-vs-dot-netflix}

In 2000, Blockbuster made almost $800 million in late fees ([roughly 16 percent of its revenue](http://archive.boston.com/business/articles/2010/09/23/blockbuster_tries_to_rewrite_script_in_bankruptcy/)).


#### Recruiting: Monster vs. LinkedIn {#recruiting-monster-vs-dot-linkedin}


#### Hospitality: Airbnb vs. Hotels {#hospitality-airbnb-vs-dot-hotels}

Digital transformation reaches all aspects of human society, and will continue to influence software creation and delivery. As [Marc Andreessen]({{< relref "20211211010651-marc_andreessen.md" >}}) famously said, “[Software is eating the world](http://www.aberdeeninvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Why-Software-Is-Eating-The-World-8-20-111.pdf),” meaning every company will become a software company, engaging with its customers through digital channels.


### 1.2 Customer Expectations are Constantly Evolving {#1-dot-2-customer-expectations-are-constantly-evolving}

Bill Price, President of Driva Solutions and author of “Your Customer Rules!,” points out that as an engineer or procurement manager is buying software, he or she is exposed to multiple customer experiences.


### 1.3 The Third Wave of SaaS: The Customer Experience Era {#1-dot-3-the-third-wave-of-saas-the-customer-experience-era}

The early days of digital transformation brought a new subscription-based business model to enterprise software.


#### First wave: from on-premise to the cloud {#first-wave-from-on-premise-to-the-cloud}

Salesforce pioneered and popularized the SaaS model for enterprise software.


#### Second wave: new processes and workflows plus affordability {#second-wave-new-processes-and-workflows-plus-affordability}

SaaS companies in the second wave (the SaaS 2.0 era) brought more features to customers at a lower cost.


#### Third wave: customer experience and personalization {#third-wave-customer-experience-and-personalization}

Customers now research, evaluate, select, and share experiences that feel more like consumer experiences, involving numerous interactions across multiple touchpoints.

McKinsey research (23) shows that, on average, “a B2B customer will regularly use six different interaction channels throughout the decision journey, and almost 65 percent will come away from it frustrated by inconsistent experiences” across these channels.


## Chapter 2: Defining Customer Experience <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-2-defining-customer-experience}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_012552screenshot.png" >}}


### 2.1 What Are Customer Experience, Touchpoints, Interactions, and Engagements? {#2-dot-1-what-are-customer-experience-touchpoints-interactions-and-engagements}

It’s the totality of all touchpoints, interactions, and engagements with a company or brand.

if customer expectations are very high, even a great performance can fall short; and in most companies, marketing and sales set those expectations

[User Experience]({{< relref "20210731181956-user_experience.md" >}}) Customer experience (CX) is a customer’s perception about a company, brand, or product, based on all touchpoints, interactions, and engagements.

It’s inherently a balanced relationship between what each customer expects, and what he or she gets.
This is why customer experience should include a whole universe of touchpoints, interactions, and engagement that a customer has with a company, brand, or product.
question surfaces: what do you mean by touchpoints, interactions, and engagement? “Touchpoint” is sometimes defined as an interaction, and “customer interaction” is often used interchangeably with “customer engagement.”

[Touchpoint]({{< relref "20220702013348-touchpoint.md" >}}) (customer touchpoint) is a single moment when a customer comes in contact with, or is exposed to, a company’s brand, product, employees, or message through any channel or device.

Now let’s say you walk into a store, and notice a Nike shoe. That’s a [Touchpoint]({{< relref "20220702013348-touchpoint.md" >}}) . When you pick up a shoe to feel the texture, or try it on, that’s an interaction. In a sense, interaction is a two-way “communication” that happens between a prospective customer and the company or product.

Customer interaction is a two-way communication between a customer and a company’s brand or product.

Customer [Engagement]({{< relref "20210906161249-activation.md" >}})is a commitment or agreement of a customer to act.


### 2.2 Evaluating a Customer Experience Strategy {#2-dot-2-evaluating-a-customer-experience-strategy}

Your company not only sells products or services, but also delivers customer experience.
companies can’t fully control how customers perceive the experience.
face certain challenges when designing a customer experience strategy.

-   First,what they expect can be based on individual biases, among other things.
-   Second, B2B industry is still quite different. More complex products, longer sales cycles, and multiple stakeholders in buying decisions contribute to the complexity of overseeing
-   Third, customer experience has to be evaluated from end to end
-   Last, organizations see customer experience through the lens of a specific part of the business, such as a department

[Customer Experience Strategy]({{< relref "20210731181956-user_experience.md#customer-experience-strategy" >}}) is an ongoing process of assessing and managing customer experiences across the customer lifecycle.
companies have to design journeys for multiple stakeholders and decision makers.


### 2.3 Why is Customer Experience Critical for SaaS Companies? {#2-dot-3-why-is-customer-experience-critical-for-saas-companies}

The first major reason why customer experience is critical in today’s world is the fact that 30 percent of customers are willing to share bad experiences. Secondly, 19 percent of customers will not trust a company again after just one bad experience[^fn:1]. We believe companies are at risk of going out of business if they can’t differentiate themselves by creating meaningful customer experiences.


#### Customer experience as a competitive advantage {#customer-experience-as-a-competitive-advantage}


#### Customer experience as a growth engine {#customer-experience-as-a-growth-engine}


### 2.4 Why is Personalization Intrinsic to Customer Experience? {#2-dot-4-why-is-personalization-intrinsic-to-customer-experience}

[Personalization]({{< relref "20220316171631-personalization.md" >}}) is a process of tailoring a service or product, message, experience, price, or preferred channel to accommodate a specific customer.


## Chapter 3: Show, Don’t Tell <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-3-show-don-t-tell}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_142541screenshot.png" >}}

we cover six essential steps for evolving to become an experience-centric organization:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_142648screenshot.png" >}}


### 3.1 The Buying Process Outweighs the Sales Process {#3-dot-1-the-buying-process-outweighs-the-sales-process}


### 3.2 Why Traditional Customer Acquisition Falls Short <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#3-dot-2-why-traditional-customer-acquisition-falls-short}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_142836screenshot.png" >}}

Why isn’t this approach very effective?
Imagine that you have to talk to a sales clerk in front of the store and share your e-mail and other contact information just to walk in. Would you consider this a good customer experience?


### 3.3 Getting Personal is Paramount {#3-dot-3-getting-personal-is-paramount}

Allowing prospects to sign up and try a product improves customer experiences, and provides teams with relevant behavioral data that helps them further personalize the experience — and that ultimately yields a loyal customer and higher lifetime value.


### 3.4 Buyers Want to Go It Alone {#3-dot-4-buyers-want-to-go-it-alone}

According to Forrester Research, 59 percent of B2B buyers prefer not to interact with a sales rep, and [74 percent find buying from a website more convenient](https://www.forrester.com/report/Death+Of+A+B2B+Salesman/-/E-RES122288)

> 也并非完全如此，我自己作为客户在调研一些新的产品的时候，要分两种情况，一种是产品本身在网站上的信息已经足够让我理解这是一款怎样的产品，通过产品介绍和一些简单的 demo 我其实可以自己上手这款产品了，对于这种情况，我并不需要 Sales 接入，如果有明确的价格其实就可以自己决定是否需要购买了。
>
> 另外一个是产品本身特别复杂，即便是观看 demo 也不能完全了解产品，或者是产品是在一个完全新的领域，应该如何正确的使用这款产品都需要 Sales 来帮助介绍和理解。


### 3.5 Customer Experience Requires a New Way of Thinking and Acting <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#3-dot-5-customer-experience-requires-a-new-way-of-thinking-and-acting}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_150518screenshot.png" >}}


### 3.6 Embracing a [Bottom-Up Sales]({{< relref "20220702150735-bottom_up_sales.md" >}}) Strategy {#3-dot-6-embracing-a-bottom-up-sales--20220702150735-bottom-up-sales-dot-md--strategy}

Trello, Zoom.us, and Asana drive customer acquisition with a bottom-up sales strategy, thus getting individuals in organizations to use their products first; and if the product is valuable for them, the rest of the organization is more likely to adopt it.


## Chapter 4: Taking an Outside-In Perspective of the Customer Lifecycle <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-4-taking-an-outside-in-perspective-of-the-customer-lifecycle}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_150830screenshot.png" >}}

First, agile methodologies emphasized shorter development cycles to minimize risk and ensure a shorter feedback loop from customers.
Second, agile shifted the focus from the product lifecycle to the customer lifecycle as the primary GTM strategy.


### 4.1 What is a Product Lifecycle? {#4-dot-1-what-is-a-product-lifecycle}

[Product Lifecycle]({{< relref "20211227191240-product_lifecycle.md" >}}) is a framework that helps a company organize its marketing and sales of a product, from introducing it to the market to when sales peak and decline.
Figure 4.1 shows a classic product lifecycle diagram where each stage corresponds to specific sales and marketing strategies, [programs, and campaigns](https://www.coursehero.com/study-guides/boundless-marketing/product-life-cycles/).

For example, [Amazon releases new software every 11.6 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxk8b9rSKOo)! This became possible thanks to a new set of technologies called “[continuous deployment](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-personalized-user-experience-intrinsic-product-nick-bonfiglio/)”.


#### What Is the Customer Lifecycle? {#what-is-the-customer-lifecycle}

[Customer Lifecycle]({{< relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md" >}}) is a framework that describes the process a customer goes through when considering, buying, using, and advocating use of a product or service.

a customer lifecycle is a continuous process of retaining, expanding, and creating loyal customers

We included a y-axis to show whether a prospective customer has access to, and interacts with, the product at a particular stage.
The x-axis shows the time it takes for a prospect to progress.

In addition to taking into consideration metrics like customer satisfaction and [Net Promoter Score]({{< relref "20220702151849-net_promoter_score.md" >}})(NPS), this customer lifecycle views customers as loyal after they renew their subscription for the first time.


### 4.2 The Four Stages of the SaaS Customer Lifecycle {#4-dot-2-the-four-stages-of-the-saas-customer-lifecycle}

let’s break down the four critical stages of a SaaS customer lifecycle: acquisition, adoption, retention, and expansion ([modified based the following Customer Lifecycle framework](https://www.mykpono.com/how-to-track-customer-acquisitions/)):


#### Acquisition stage {#acquisition-stage}

The business goal is to influence prospects to try a product or service.

-   **Customer goal**: Quickly assess pain-product fit and obvious benefits
-   **Question**: Does this product address my immediate needs?
-   **Customer action**: Signup/Trial

Customer experience focus:

-   What customer segments should we engage, and what’s the value of features we should be promoting?
-   How can we reduce friction for buyers and influence them to try our solution?


#### Adoption stage {#adoption-stage}

The business goal is to onboard prospects and showcase relevant value of the product.

-   **Customer goal**: Learn how to use the product, evaluate it, and make a buying decision
-   **Question**: Is this product easy to use? Does it address my needs? Do I want to buy it?
-   **Customer action**: Onboarding/Initial value delivered/Convert to customer

Customer experience focus:

-   How can we make customer experience a core value that our solution delivers?
-   How can we accelerate and increase the trial-to-customer conversion rate
-   How can we nurture and re-engage customers with the product based on unique customer behaviors?


#### Retention stage {#retention-stage}

The business goal is to ensure that customers receive expected value from the product regularly, and possess knowledge about newly released product features and capabilities.

-   **Customer goal**: Receive value and benefit from the product
-   **Question**: Do I still value and want to actively use this product? Is this product essential to achieving my personal and/or professional goals?
-   **Customer action**: Daily Active User (DAU)/Monthly Active User (MAU)

Customer experience focus:

-   How can we ensure customers continuously receive value from using the product?
-   How does customer behavior in the product help to prevent churn and predict CLV?


#### Expansion stage <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#expansion-stage}

The business goal is to influence customers to renew, increase product usage, purchase an upsell or cross-sell, and advocate use of the product.

-   **Customer goal**: Explore how to be more empowered and successful
-   **Question**: Will I become more effective with increased product usage or new features?
-   **Customer action**: Renewal/Upsell/Cross-sell/Advocate

Customer experience focus:

-   How can we deliver features and experiences that are more valuable to customers, and influence them to buy more or upgrade their subscription
-   How can we enable our customers to become public advocates?

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_154156screenshot.png" >}}

Table 4.1 summarizes customer and business goals for each stage of the lifecycle. When companies use a customer lifecycle framework, they can reevaluate their own processes to ensure that organizational goals are aligned with customer needs and expectations. From the customer lifecycle, we can infer the following:

-   Every stage in the customer lifecycle corresponds to a specific need that must be addressed before a customer moves to the next stage, resulting in deeper engagement with a product and the company.
-   Three out of four stages (adoption, retention, and expansion) occur while the customer uses the product. As a result, in-product behaviors and engagement and behavioral data should influence most of the customer journey throughout the lifecycle.
-   The new customer acquisition process is closing the gap between the time the prospect and company engage in conversation, and the time the prospect tries the product.
-   Retention and expansion stages in a customer lifecycle are a continuous process of delivering value to the customer. See the highlighted “loyalty loop” in the customer lifecycle diagram (Figure 4.2).
-   The earlier product lifecycle approach encouraged companies to focus on marketing and sales strategies based on where the product was in the cycle. Customer lifecycle puts customers at the center, and helps companies focus on how to market and sell software products in response to customer needs and preferences.


## Chapter 5: Understanding the Whole Customer Journey <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-5-understanding-the-whole-customer-journey}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_154304screenshot.png" >}}

The [Customer Journey]({{< relref "20211113002725-user_journey_map.md" >}}) is a series of all touchpoints a customer has with a company, brand, or product to reach a certain milestone.
While individual customer journeys can vary greatly from one customer to another, SaaS companies need to understand the overall pattern.

Improving the [Customer Experience]({{< relref "20210731181956-user_experience.md" >}}) starts with the company understanding its [Customer Lifecycle]({{< relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md" >}}). The next step is evaluating current journeys, and designing new optimal ones that lead customers to desired outcomes and milestones.

To summarize, the process of transitioning to a customer-experience company follows these steps:

-   [Customer Lifecycle]({{< relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md" >}})
    What is the customer lifecycle for our most profitable customers? How can we make this lifecycle as rewarding and frictionless as possible?
-   [Customer Journey]({{< relref "20211113002725-user_journey_map.md" >}})
    What are the most important customer journeys? What milestones advance the customer along the lifecycle?
-   [Touchpoint]({{< relref "20220702013348-touchpoint.md" >}}), interactions, and [Engagement]({{< relref "20210906161249-activation.md" >}}).
    What are the most optimal touchpoints and interaction for each customer journey? Can some be eliminated or simplified?


### 5.1 Tracking Customer Journeys <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#5-dot-1-tracking-customer-journeys}

[In-Product Customer Journey]({{< relref "20220702155637-in_product_user_journey.md" >}}) is a sequence of all touchpoints that a customer has inside the product.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_155844screenshot.png" >}}

We send a reminder e-mail to him; John opens it, but doesn’t return to the product. Two days later, we send another reminder to entice John to come back, create a product, and install JS code. This time, John returns to the app and creates a new product that generates a unique code. Since we are not collecting any data for John’s product, we know he didn’t install JS code, so we send a reminder e-mail. The next day, Aptrinsic starts collecting analytics data for John’s product, which means he installed the JS code. The journey to realize initial value is complete. Reaching this milestone allows John to track and analyze his product inside of Aptrinsic. It also allows us to track his product usage and optimize his engagement.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_160033screenshot.png" >}}

Danielle starts with the same touchpoint as John, and signs up for a free trial; but unlike John, Danielle engages with the product right away using essential product features that showcase the initial product value to first-time users. During the initial free trial signup, Danielle completes onboarding and creates a new product that generates a unique JS code. She then logs in to the product the next day and receives an in-product notification to install the JS code and start collecting product analytics data.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_172657screenshot.png" >}}

Figure 5.3 shows both journeys in the context of the customer lifecycle.
The velocity with which a prospect moves through the lifecycle to reach the next stage is a very important factor to consider and prioritize. Shorter time to value will likely correlate with higher probability to close and to become a highly satisfied DAU.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_172810screenshot.png" >}}

If we plotted many customer journeys into the customer lifecycle, we could identify the optimal path to initial value.

Every touchpoint and interaction along the journey is an opportunity for the company to influence the prospective customer’s impression and create a deeper relationship between the company and prospective customer. This is what could be referred to as a Moment of Truth.

A [Moment of Truth]({{< relref "20220702173833-moment_of_truth.md" >}})(MOT), in marketing, is the moment when a customer/user interacts with a brand, product, or service in a way that serves to form or change an impression about that brand, product, or service.


### 5.2 Mind the Value Gap! {#5-dot-2-mind-the-value-gap}

This is what we call a [Value Gap]({{< relref "20220702174017-value_gap.md" >}}). It is a difference between expected and delivered (or perceived) value.
A [Value Gap]({{< relref "20220702174017-value_gap.md" >}}) is the discrepancy between what a customer expects from the product and the value received or perceived.

A Value Gap can happen for many reasons, but here are some big ones:

-   Product fails to provide adequate value
-   Customer is the wrong fit for the product
-   Customer doesn’t understand a product’s capabilities or how to use it
-   Customer experiences something jarring or painful (i.e., confusion, dissatisfaction, competitive incentive, etc.) that changes their perception while using the product

In the example of John and Danielle’s journeys, we defined initial value as a milestone when the prospect installs tracking code and starts collecting product analytics data.

[Initial Value]({{< relref "20220702175445-initial_value.md" >}}) is when a customer first experiences product value.

let’s see how different companies define [Initial Value]({{< relref "20220702175445-initial_value.md" >}}):

-   For Asana, initial value can mean creating a new project, with tasks successfully assigned to a team member.
-   For Zoom.us, it can mean signing up, organizing, and holding the first video conference.
-   For Expensify, it could be creating the first expense report that is approved for payment.
-   For Aptrinsic, initial value is delivered when a customer signs up, installs our tracking JS, and starts receiving product usage data from their customers.


### 5.3 What are Value or Golden Features? {#5-dot-3-what-are-value-or-golden-features}

[Value Features]({{< relref "20220702180301-value_features.md" >}}) — sometimes known as “golden features” — are a set of product features that a prospect or customer must use to realize value and advance to the next stage of the customer lifecycle. During customer acquisition and adoption, value features guide prospects through a core use case, which is a common customer journey that users experience on a regular basis.


### 5.4 Key Takeaways {#5-dot-4-key-takeaways}

-   An in-product customer journey is a set of all prospect/customer touchpoints inside the product.
-   Giving prospective customers access to the product early in the acquisition stage reduces a marketing team’s reliance on engagements outside the product and increases the importance and impact of product engagements.
-   While they’re in the product, prospects and customers are more likely to experience a MoT, when they form or change an impression about the brand, product, or service.
-   A Value Gap occurs when there’s a discrepancy between what the customer expects from the product and the value he or she actually receives or perceives. The company then must re-engage the customer right away to close the gap.
-   An Engagement Loop uses product usage data to influence prospects and customers to re-engage.
-   A Loyalty Loop delivers substantial value and experience to keep customers using the product and adopting new features, leading eventually to renewal.
-   The initial value unit is an engagement, or set of engagements, that advances the customer through a core use case. Valued (golden) features are ones a prospect or customer must use to realize initial value.


## Chapter 6: From Silos to a Cross-functional Focus on Customer Experience <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-6-from-silos-to-a-cross-functional-focus-on-customer-experience}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_161413screenshot.png" >}}

Customer lifecycle bubbles up critical questions, like:

-   Why do customers and organizations buy what they buy?
-   How do they buy?


### 6.1 The Traditional Customer Handoff is Ineffective {#6-dot-1-the-traditional-customer-handoff-is-ineffective}

Figure 6.1 shows that each team is responsible for only part of the customer lifecycle. A prospective customer is passed from one department to another.
Further, each department has goals and incentives that are aligned only with the part of the customer lifecycle for which they are responsible. The marketing team is incentivized based on leads; sales is based on demos and closed deals; customer success on churn rate and renewals.
for example, a customer receives multiple e-mails — from marketing telling them about an upcoming webinar, from the customer success team notifying them about their upcoming renewal, and from the product team informing them about a new feature release.
On top of that, each department is likely to use its own technology to send customer communications.

In his book [The Sales Acceleration Formula]({{< relref "20210804233445-the_sales_acceleration_formula_using_data_technology_and_inbound_selling_to_go_from_0_to_100_million.md" >}}), Mark Roberge explains how Hubspot changed sales compensation plans to address a growing customer churn rate1. This is the first and critical step of sales and customer success teams: sharing responsibility for CLV and churn rate.


### 6.2 Why Aren’t Product Teams More Involved in the Customer Acquisition Process? <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#6-dot-2-why-aren-t-product-teams-more-involved-in-the-customer-acquisition-process}

Undoubtedly, the marketing, sales, customer success, and product teams should all be responsible for the customer experience. It is not easy to do.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_164802screenshot.png" >}}


### 6.3 Unified Customer Profile Data is Essential to Stellar Customer Experiences {#6-dot-3-unified-customer-profile-data-is-essential-to-stellar-customer-experiences}

To be successful at providing a personalized customer experience, your organization needs a single system of record for all customer profile, company, and behavioral data.
Wondering if your organization is suffering because of these issues? Ask yourself these questions:

-   How often do your top 20 percent of customers, based on annual contract, log in to your product?
-   What are the top in-product journeys for these customers, from adoption to expansion?
-   What are the top three features that these customers use?
-   How quickly can you design messages to engage a customer or showcase your new features?
-   What features cause customers to stop using the product?
-   Where in the top three customer journeys are your prospects and clients getting stuck?

Unified customer data should include these details:

-   Profile data: name, title, contact information
-   Company data (a.k.a. firmographics): size, subscription level, support tickets for all organizations and regions
-   Behavioral data: daily/monthly active users, number of logins over a period of time, number of completed core use cases, number of features interacted with


### 6.4 From Department Goals to Customer-Centric Goals <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#6-dot-4-from-department-goals-to-customer-centric-goals}

The first step is to tie [Customer Experience Metric]({{< relref "20210731181956-user_experience.md#customer-experience-metric" >}})s to the core objectives and goals of each department. [LTV]({{< relref "20210731022109-customer_lifetime_value.md" >}}) is one of the best metrics to measure and evaluate the long-term health of customer relationships. Net Promoter Score ([NPS]({{< relref "20220702151849-net_promoter_score.md" >}})) is another metric that measures customer satisfaction and how customers value the experience with your product and company.
As a guide,[look at how Hubspot changed its sales compensation plan to reflect CLV](https://thinkgrowth.org/how-sales-comp-plans-impact-customer-churn-23a15ecad5ef).

Table 6.1 summarizes the metrics each department traditionally tracks throughout the customer acquisition process.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_170053screenshot.png" >}}

In Table 6.2, below, we’ve added the product team to show how its goals, activities, and metrics fit with the whole customer acquisition process.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_170219screenshot.png" >}}

How does this all relate to a personalized customer experience? It’s about creating alignment and insight to meet and exceed customer expectations.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_170409screenshot.png" >}}


### 6.5 Key Takeaways {#6-dot-5-key-takeaways}

-   Customer lifecycle enables companies to focus on the buying process from the customer’s point of view rather than from the sales process standpoint.
-   Siloed departments make it difficult to design seamless customer experiences.
-   Product teams need to be more active in the customer acquisition process and overall customer lifecycle.
-   Aggregating customer data across many technologies, managed by different departments, is challenging. Production data and in-product customer behavioral data are essential to creating a unified customer profile view.
-   Insufficient customer data is only part of the problem. Companies need tools to create personalized engagement based on timely access to customer data collected across multiple channels.


## Chapter 7: From a Traditional Go-To-Market to a Product-led Go-To-Market Strategy <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-7-from-a-traditional-go-to-market-to-a-product-led-go-to-market-strategy}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_170843screenshot.png" >}}

Here is the definition of a traditional GTM strategy:
[Go-to-Market Strategy]({{< relref "20210812231906-go_to_market.md#go-to-market-strategy" >}}) is an action plan that describes repeatable and scalable processes for how a company acquires, retains, and grows customers.

a [GTM Strategy]({{< relref "20210812231906-go_to_market.md#go-to-market-strategy" >}}) must be repeatable and scalable.

-   Repeatable means that the organization can expect very similar results when executing against a particular GTM playbook.
-   Scalable means the company can hire and train new employees using the GTM playbook, and see proportional revenue growth in acquiring customers.

but in the last two decades, digital transformation drove an explosion of new channels for organizations to reach prospective customers.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_171445screenshot.png" >}}

This new strategy is referred to as a product-led GTM strategy.
[Product-Led Go-to-Market]({{< relref "20220703171641-product_led_go_to_market.md" >}}) strategy is an action plan that describes repeatable and scalable processes for how a company acquires, retains, and grows customers, driven by in-product customer behavior, feedback, product usage, and analytics.

In fact, OpenView, a venture capital firm, says your [product is a key part of your marketing](https://openviewpartners.com/blog/product-led-growth-marketing-strategies/#.WdPoi4plAUG).

### 7.1 Are Marketing-Qualified Leads (MQLs) Dead? {#7-dot-1-are-marketing-qualified-leads--mqls--dead}

Gating content as a way to generate leads has become increasingly less effective.

the average [Conversion Rate]({{< relref "20220305090504-conversion.md#conversion-rate" >}}) from visitor to lead is around 5 to 15 percent.
the conversion rate from lead to a won deal is anywhere from 1 to 10 percent.

What about [Lead Nurturing]({{< relref "20220703172740-lead_nurturing.md" >}}) and [Lead Scoring]({{< relref "20220703172757-lead_scoring.md" >}})?
Lead nurturing based only on contact information (i.e., demographic data) and marketing activities (e.g., opened e-mail, visited web page) can’t be very effective.
As a result, sales teams spend time working and further qualifying these leads as SQLs. This not only makes things inefficient, it increases the CAC.

If you want to explore this further, read why Tom Wentworth, CMO of RapidMiner, is [killing MQLs](https://tomwentworth.com/2016/05/17/why-im-killing-the-marketing-qualified-lead-95c90874bc6f/).

Some of the fastest-growing companies in recent years do not put any lead generation forms on their websites, and instead invite prospects to try their products. This list includes Zoom.us, Asana, inVision, and Slack — and it’s growing.

A [Content Strategy]({{< relref "20220703173433-content_strategy.md" >}})
has become one of the most efficient ways for companies to engage with prospects, by educating target audiences (prospects and customers) on industry trends, new strategies, and tactics.


### 7.2 What Are Product-Qualified Leads (PQLs)? {#7-dot-2-what-are-product-qualified-leads--pqls}

[PQL]({{< relref "20210924095503-product_qualified_lead.md" >}}) concept is in an article by Tomasz Tunguz from early 2013, “[The Product-Qualified Lead (PQL)](https://tomtunguz.com/the-new-sales-hotness-the-product-qualified-lead-pql/).”
the PQL only makes sense as part of a larger, product-led GTM strategy.

We believe PQLs are a better way for cross-functional teams to create sales-ready accounts and more active customers.

[Product-Qualified Lead]({{< relref "20210924095503-product_qualified_lead.md" >}}) (PQL) is a prospect that signed up and demonstrated buying intent based on product interest, usage, and behavioral data.

Instead of driving prospects to lead forms, a product-led GTM strategy drives prospects to sign up for a product or free trial.
A product-led GTM strategy streamlines the customer acquisition process for SaaS organizations by focusing on one entry point for prospects.
They also afford the company’s teams the opportunity to analyze [how prospects interact with the product in their natural environment](https://review.firstround.com/amazons-friction-killing-tactics-to-make-products-more-seamless).

In the article “Why Product-Qualified Leads are the Answer to a Failing Freemium Model”, Christopher ODonnell explains why PQLs are critical for companies with a freemium business model.

### 7.3 The Traditional Approach to Customer Acquisition Process {#7-dot-3-the-traditional-approach-to-customer-acquisition-process}

What is important to highlight is that a large portion of the traditional customer acquisition process happens outside of the product.


### 7.4 A Product-led Approach to the Customer Acquisition Process <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#7-dot-4-a-product-led-approach-to-the-customer-acquisition-process}

Figure 7.2 shows how this strategy significantly reduces the time it takes for prospects to access the product.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_180240screenshot.png" >}}

[Dropbox]({{< relref "20211230140136-dropbox.md" >}}) is an example of a company that drives prospects directly into the product and nurtures them until they are ready to buy.

As shown, product-led GTM strategies provide several benefits.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_180633screenshot.png" >}}

Simply put, your product should be at the center of your GTM strategy — your action plan for how your company acquires, retains, and grows customers.

### 8.1 The Four Essential Elements of a Product-Led GTM Strategy {#8-dot-1-the-four-essential-elements-of-a-product-led-gtm-strategy}

Developing an effective [Product-Led GTM Strategy]({{< relref "20220703171641-product_led_go_to_market.md" >}}) requires companies to analyze each of the four must-have elements of a GTM strategy by answering these questions:

    -   Crucial customer journeys
    -   Initial value
    -   User onboarding and product adoption metrics

For the early stage startup, the first milestone in executing a GTM strategy is reaching [Product-Market Fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}).
[Product-Market Fit]({{< relref "20210806234604-product_market_fit.md" >}}) is an experimentation process of finding customers in a target market with a problem that your product can address, for a price (or total cost of ownership) below the level of value that’s provided in exchange.

We suggest reading “[12 Things About Product-Market Fit](https://future.com/about-product-market-fit/)” by Tren Griffin, and “[Product/Market Fit: What It Really Means, How to Measure It, and Where to Find It](https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/product-market-fit-what-it-really-means-how-to-measure-it-and-where-to-find-it-70e746be907b)” by Eric Jorgenson, for more detailed overviews.

A broader but related concept, company/market fit, may be more relevant, since it combines pain-product fit and customer-message fit ideas. You can find a more detailed overview in Part 1 of [How to Develop Strategic Messaging and Positioning](https://www.mykpono.com/strategic-communication-how-to-develop-strategic-messaging-and-positioning/).

Tae Hea Nahm, co-founder and managing director at Storm Ventures, and he underscored...main reason startups with a product/market fit fail to accelerate growth is due to lack of a repeatable and scalable [GTM Strategy]({{< relref "20210812231906-go_to_market.md#go-to-market-strategy" >}}).

All four aspects of a GTM strategy — customer, market, product, and channels — are influenced by a product-led approach.


## Chapter 9: Driving Customer Acquisition and Adoption with a Product-Led Strategy <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-9-driving-customer-acquisition-and-adoption-with-a-product-led-strategy}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_191249screenshot.png" >}}

[Product-Led GTM Strategy]({{< relref "20220703171641-product_led_go_to_market.md" >}}) affects the four major phases of the customer lifecycle: acquisition, adoption, retention, and expansion.


### 9.1 The Four Steps to Leading with a Product-Led Strategy {#9-dot-1-the-four-steps-to-leading-with-a-product-led-strategy}


#### Step 1: Drive prospects to try the product {#step-1-drive-prospects-to-try-the-product}

-   First, marketing uses a single CTA, where the signup page becomes a personalized landing page.
-   Second, a product-led approach provides marketing teams with a new dimension of data: product usage.

Here is an example of this at work. Let’s take PandaDoc
For example, PandaDoc found that shorter proposals, sent earlier in the day, with a deadline attached, are signed faster.


#### Step 2: Design your free trial process or freemium offer <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#step-2-design-your-free-trial-process-or-freemium-offer}

define freemium and free trial strategies:

[Freemium]({{< relref "20220703193346-freemium.md" >}}) is a customer acquisition model that provides access to part of a software product to prospects free of charge, without a time limit.

[Free Trial]({{< relref "20220703192450-free_trial.md" >}}) is a customer acquisition model that provides a partial or complete product to prospects free of charge for a limited time. Typically, a free trial runs for 14 or 30 days.

Remember: A [Freemium]({{< relref "20220703193346-freemium.md" >}}) product does not limit the amount of time a prospect can access the software, but often limits users in some way, such as through stripped-back features or allowed amount of usage. Slack employs a freemium model, and so do Zoom.us, Dropbox, and Asana. Companies such as Atlassian, Github, and Twilio focused on the developer market, and started with freemium.

When deciding whether a free trial or freemium strategy...Jason M. Lemkin outlines the math behind making freemium work in his article “[Why You Need 50 Million Active Users for Freemium to Actually Work](https://www.saastr.com/you-need-50-million-users-for-freemium-to-actually-work/)”. Suffice to say, the addressable market should be large enough for you to capture a significant chunk of it and be profitable while only converting 10 percent of free users. The pros and cons of freemium and free trial are highlighted in Table 9.1.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_192743bxasouukzbvteugayw9p.png" >}}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Freemium model considerations

    There are many ways to structure a [Freemium]({{< relref "20220703193346-freemium.md" >}}) offering, including feature-limited, capacity-limited, seat-limited, customer-class-limited, support-limited, and time- or bandwidth-limited. Lincoln Murphy’s article[provides a good overview of seven types of freemium to consider](https://www.saastr.com/you-need-50-million-users-for-freemium-to-actually-work/).

    Here are questions for your team to ask when considering a [Freemium]({{< relref "20220703193346-freemium.md" >}}) model:

    -   How much will it cost to sustain a large segment of free customers? Is a freemium model scalable for your business?
    -   Can we provide enough value for users to realize product benefits but still limit value to entice them to pay for a subscription?
    -   How difficult is it to get started with the product? Does it require technical integration and broader organizational approval?
    -   How will we nurture and prioritize freemium users that are ready to purchase?
    -   Are we attracting the right kind of customer (i.e., a customer in our target market with a real need, an urgency to purchase, and a desire to expand the subscription)?

    To recap, [Freemium]({{< relref "20220703193346-freemium.md" >}}) makes more sense when your organization is facing:

    -   A large addressable market
    -   Low costs to serve free users
    -   Low barriers/commitment for users to start with your product

<!--list-separator-->

-  Free trial considerations <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span>

    The goal of the [Free Trial]({{< relref "20220703192450-free_trial.md" >}}) is to deliver as much value as possible to users during their trial period.

    questions to consider before deciding whether a free trial strategy is right for your organization:

    -   How long does it take for prospects to realize initial value on average? How long should the trial last?
    -   What features can and should our team limit or remove from the free trial process?
    -   How do we nurture a free-trial user? What in-product behavior correlates with an optimal trial-to-customer conversion rate?

    Table 9.2 outlines important considerations for launching a successful free trial process, and shows how it maps to our own software trial process.

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_193155fhyajvta3me46xjxsb6g.png" >}}

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_193214zw0h3ugnvtaxpgmxfbxt.png" >}}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Personalizing the experience

    any part of the free trial experience can be personalized. Not only can the product be personalized, but so can the customer acquisition experience — through the free trial, pricing, messaging, and contextual engagement.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Initial signup process considerations

    Minimizing the amount of information required for prospects to sign up, and reducing the number of steps in the signup process, are easy ways to improve the experience from the start.

    Design a signup process that only highlights one action per step. Avoid asking for personal or contact information that is not essential to get started with your product, unless it increases the value your product can deliver.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Initial value and customer journey considerations

    Prospects who sign up for your free trials should experience initial value (or a desired outcome), ideally in an experience that doesn’t turn them off.

    Next, you must enable them to accomplish their goal as easily as possible to reach the initial value.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Free trial duration and usage frequency considerations

    whenever a prospect realizes initial value and reaches PQL status, this signals a good time for your sales team to engage in a buying conversation.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Free trials and a new wave of growth-hacking

    Free trials can support personalized growth strategies, such as extending a free trial if a prospect completes a certain number of actions or invites more team members to participate.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Product demos during free trials

    Offer prospects a free trial, and then a personalized demo, if your product is more complex or requires more effort to set up and onboard.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Measuring free trial success

    These are common metrics for measuring success:

    -   Number of trial signups, PQLs, and closed deals
    -   Average time from signup to PQL (time to initial value)
    -   Trial-to-PQL conversion rate
    -   Average engagement based on features and timeframe
    -   Frequencies of login (daily, times/week)
    -   Number of prospects per account


#### Step 3: Create onboarding experiences {#step-3-create-onboarding-experiences}

[User Onboarding]({{< relref "20220704195112-user_onboarding.md" >}}) is how a prospect moves through initial signup, experiences initial value, and reaches PQL status. It is designed to help users become familiar with the product and realize initial value as soon as possible.

[Customer Onboarding]({{< relref "20220704195159-customer_onboarding.md" >}}) is the process of getting a newly subscribed customer (or account) up and running effectively with your product, which usually includes much guidance and hand-holding. The goal here is to set the customer up to realize the full value of your product, thereby retaining customers while also expanding business within the account, or getting referrals from your happy customers.

Ideally, a person will onboard twice — first as a user, and then as a customer — but then they move into the adoption process.

<!--list-separator-->

-  How Aptrinsic onboards prospects <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span>

    Figure 9.2 outlines how we at Aptrinsic think about onboarding our prospects and customers.

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220704_195348screenshot.png" >}}

    -   Phase 1: Reaching initial value
        Milestone #1: Install JS code and start collecting data
    -   Phase 2: Setting up Aptrinsic Product Mapper™
        Milestone #2: Collecting usage data for specific product features + becoming PQL
    -   Phase 3: Designing onboarding experience
        Milestone #3: Prospect launches onboarding experience for customers
    -   Phase 4: Sending first campaign
        Milestone #4: Prospect’s onboarding is completeWe organized our onboarding experience into four phases and defined milestones for each. The order of these phases can change, but for prospects to understand the value of our product, they have to complete all four phases.

    As soon as a prospect reaches PQL status, our SDR is notified to follow up with the prospect to offer a personalized demo of the full product.

<!--list-separator-->

-  How to Ensure a Successful Prospect Onboarding Experience

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  1. Define onboarding goals and milestones

        What set of actions must prospects complete to realize the full value of our product?

        Aptrinsic example:

        -   Goal: Prospect (account) launches first onboarding experience for its customers and sends first engagement campaign.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  2. Simplify customer journeys

        To recap, customer journeys should:

        -   Include one action per step
        -   Be limited to 5–7 steps to complete a milestone
        -   Guide prospects with personal and simple messages

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  3. Get to initial value quickly

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  4. Address “zero data/empty state”

        “Zero data” or “empty state” is what prospects see during their initial signup process when no data is available in the product. The way to address this issue is to guide the prospect through a journey that populates, uploads, or integrates data into your product. Benjamin Brandall, in his article “[The Most Overlooked Aspect of UX Design Could Be the Most Important](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/22/the-most-overlooked-aspect-of-ux-design-could-be-the-most-important/)”, argues that empty state is a great opportunity for teams to highlight emotional connections with users.
        You might get inspired by the [40 clever empty state designs for mobile apps](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/mobile-app-empty-state-designs/) shared in this article by Nancy Young.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  5. Define a PQL

        While the definition of a PQL remains consistent from company to company,
        For example, at Aptrinsic, a PQL is a prospect that completes Milestone 1 + Milestone 2.
        Aptrinsic PQL = install JS code (Milestone 1) + set up Product Mapper (Milestone 2)

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  6. Personalize the onboarding experience with custom journeys

        For example, a progress bar and checklist can show prospects where they are in the product setup process.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  7. Nurture with personalized communication

        In-product messages are effective for influencing customers to engage in specific ways, because they’re already in the product.

        You can configure e-mails to be triggered to send automatically based on a prospect’s action or inaction, reminding them about product value and driving them back into the product with a single CTA.

        Other examples of action-based (or time-based) communication triggered by a specific action or inaction include welcome e-mails and notifications that the app started collecting data or that a team member joined the product.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  8. Document important customer journeys

        During the onboarding process, prospects may complete a product tour or a walk-through, but over time they will likely forget how to accomplish a task and turn to documentation, which can guide them step by step. Detailed documentation can even assist prospects in evaluating the core values and ease of using your product. Asana provides an example of clear and helpful documentation in its resource center.

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  9. Measure and track prospects through onboarding

        you must focus on these two aspects:

        -   Understanding where prospects fall off (abandon the journey)
        -   Understanding the velocity at which prospects move through milestones

        For tracking, consider:

        -   Number of prospects signed up
        -   Number of prospects that started vs. number who completed journeys and milestones
        -   How prospects complete each step in the journey

        To recap, here are the nine steps:

        -   Define onboarding goals and milestones
        -   Simplify customer journeys
        -   Get to initial value quickly
        -   Address “zero data/empty state”
        -   Define a PQL
        -   Personalize the onboarding experience with custom journeys
        -   Nurture with personalized communication
        -   Document important customer journeys
        -   Measure and track prospects through onboarding

        Important Note: The initial signup and prospect onboarding experience is a critical step in moving users through the customer lifecycle — delivering initial value, reaching PQL, and so on. Customer adoption and retention begins as soon as a prospect starts the signup process. Every milestone on the road to reaching onboarding success has to deliver a valuable outcome. The onboarding experience is not something to be overlooked. It’s a critical aspect of making your prospects understand the ins and outs of your product and its value. By carefully and continuously analyzing the onboarding experience, your teams will understand how effective the process is and how to improve it.


#### Step 4: Reaching PQLs and converting to customers {#step-4-reaching-pqls-and-converting-to-customers}

As prospects progress through the customer lifecycle, you want them to reach two important milestones. First, newly signed prospects should reach PQL status. Second, you want them to quickly convert from PQL to a closed deal.

When making buying decisions, prospects are often deciding between four options:

-   Use your product
-   Do it themselves
-   Don’t do it all
-   Use your competitor’s product

addressing the common reasons why prospects choose not to buy:

-   Lacks a clear understanding of your product’s value
-   Has the wrong perception of the product’s functionality
-   Doesn’t know how to use your product
-   Wasn’t onboarded quickly enough or wasn’t re-engaged at the right time
-   Doesn’t experience pain often enough to frequently use your product
-   Requires features that are not part of your product
-   Lacks budget
-   Their tech stack doesn’t integrate well with your product

<!--list-separator-->

-  Prioritize prospects and PQLs based on in-product behaviors

<!--list-separator-->

-  Automate self-service checkout for low-touch customer segments

    In fact, studies show that 47 percent of Baby Boomers prefer self-service, while a whopping 64 percent of millennials do too. We anticipate that a larger portion of business buyers will expect self-service options going forward.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Automate just-in-time personalized engagements

<!--list-separator-->

-  Organize your teams to target the best accounts

<!--list-separator-->

-  Deliver thought leadership content at every stage of the customer lifecycle

<!--list-separator-->

-  Create targeted product demos for trial/freemium customers

    All the strategies described above in Step 4 impact at least one of the following goals:

    -   Reduce the time it takes from trial to PQL and from PQL to close
    -   Increase the Trial-to-PQL rate and PQL-to-Customer rate
    -   Increase average CLV by focusing on the right accounts

## Chapter 10: Product-led Customer Retention and Expansion <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-10-product-led-customer-retention-and-expansion}


### 10.1 How to Improve Customer Retention and Expansion {#10-dot-1-how-to-improve-customer-retention-and-expansion}


#### 1. Orchestrate customer onboarding {#1-dot-orchestrate-customer-onboarding}

Here are a couple of questions to keep in mind to help you determine which customer onboarding process(es) you need to design:

-   How many people in your customer’s organization will benefit from using your product?
-   Is your product valuable for cross-functional teams?

<!--list-separator-->

-  Ensure that the appropriate people are invited

    Another option is to come up with the list through your product experience — for instance, when you send automated e-mails to users, you can ask if anyone else within the recipient’s organization needs to get involved in the task they are working on.

    Make a target list of all people in your customer’s organization that should be using your product. If they aren’t using it now, create a plan to engage them. You may help a larger portion of the customer’s organization learn about, use, and come to depend on your product.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Review assigned admin and user roles

    If your product is going to handle the sensitive process of direct communication with your prospects and customers, you need to clearly define roles and permissions.

    Tip: Create a list of critical integrations, and design a process to ensure customers complete this process.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Train every user in your customer’s organization

    The more customers use your product, the more dependent and engaged they will become. Training can play a critical role in getting your customers to use your product regularly.

    -   Invite teammates and set up admin and access preferences
    -   Integrate with customer’s systems and third-party data sources
    -   Train everyone in your customer’s organization
    -   Ask your customer to share their goals and objectives, so your team can track success
    -   Set payment process


#### 2. Closely monitor user behavior {#2-dot-closely-monitor-user-behavior}

[Value Gap]({{< relref "20220702174017-value_gap.md" >}}) which is a discrepancy between what a customer expects and what is actually received (or their perception of what they received). In most cases, a Value Gap is a result of a decline in customer engagement in general because this often prevents them from experiencing your product’s most important features.

To get at this understanding, answer the following:

-   How often do your most profitable customers log in?
-   What features and product-usage frequencies correlate with renewals?
-   What early customer behavior signs can inform an upsell and cross-sell strategy?
-   What usage metrics help predict a user’s desire to upgrade their current subscription?

Here are examples of scenarios your teams can monitor and design behavior-based triggers around:

-   Decline in engagement
-   Increase in engagement
-   Reaching usage limit
-   Readiness to upgrade

Tip: Create competency around understanding your product’s valued features, engagement frequencies, and other customer behavior data that correlate with higher CLV via renewals, upsells, and cross-sells.


#### 3. Focus on continuous product adoption and customer nurturing {#3-dot-focus-on-continuous-product-adoption-and-customer-nurturing}

product adoption and customer nurturing work best when you continually engage customers throughout the lifecycle and deliver relevant, contextual messages in a timely manner.


#### 4. Anticipate renewal, upgrade, and cross-sell opportunities with behavior-based analytics {#4-dot-anticipate-renewal-upgrade-and-cross-sell-opportunities-with-behavior-based-analytics}

For example, if your pricing tiers are based on certain usage, then reaching the upper threshold of usage can be an effective trigger to automate an in-product or e-mail message prompting the customer to upgrade.


#### 5. Apply break-even analysis {#5-dot-apply-break-even-analysis}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Product-led GTM is a continuous process


### 10.2 Key Takeaways {#10-dot-2-key-takeaways}

-   Retention, adoption and expansion all start when customers experience your product from initial signup.
-   Identify your product champions and share the entire customer onboarding experience with them.
-   To improve customer retention and expansion with a product-led GTM strategy:
    -   Orchestrate customer onboarding — educate customers on the product and its value
    -   Invite the people who will most benefit from using your product
    -   Review assigned and user roles
    -   Integrate with the customer’s data system and third-party data sources
    -   Train every user in the customer’s organization
-   Closely monitor user behavior for frequency and use of specific features.
-   Continually engage customers throughout the lifecycle and deliver relevant, contextual messages in a timely manner.
-   Anticipate renewal, upgrade, and cross-sell opportunities by monitoring customer behavior and connecting via digital channels such as e-mail.
-   Apply break-even analysis to discover how quickly a customer becomes profitable.

### 11.2 Customer Journey and Velocity {#11-dot-2-customer-journey-and-velocity}

Tip: Map customer journeys that lead to important desired outcomes; understand how quickly customers travel through these journeys and any associated risk of losing customers before they reach their goals.


### 11.3 In-Product Behavior and Habit Creation {#11-dot-3-in-product-behavior-and-habit-creation}

Tip: Describe a day in the life of your ideal customer to understand how your product fits in, and what triggers will cause the customer to re-engage with your product.


### 11.4 Moment of Joy {#11-dot-4-moment-of-joy}

Tip: Identify core use cases and journeys where your team can create joyful moments to reinforce the value delivered with the product.


### 11.5 Nurturing and Contextual Engagements {#11-dot-5-nurturing-and-contextual-engagements}

Contextual Engagement = Customer + Trigger (Timing/Action) + Message + Channel

Let’s analyze what we mean by contextual engagement with the example depicted in Figure 11.1:

-   Customer (WHO): Someone at his tenth day in a free trial process
-   Trigger (WHEN): Hasn’t completed the journey to initial value
-   Message (WHAT): Show the benefits of reaching initial value
-   Channel (WHERE): In-product message + e-mail for a personalized experience


### 11.6 The Importance of Omnichannel and Real-Time Personalization {#11-dot-6-the-importance-of-omnichannel-and-real-time-personalization}

An omnichannel approach helps companies create contextual engagement that looks and feels the same for customers across channels and devices.


### 11.7 Experimentation and Optimization {#11-dot-7-experimentation-and-optimization}


### 11.8 Key Takeaways {#11-dot-8-key-takeaways}

There are eight ways to personalize customer engagement:

-   Segmentation: Based on demographic and behavioral data, including interaction with ads, e-mail opens, and website visits.

Note: To be successful with a product-led GTM strategy, it must become part of your organizational DNA. A leadership team should lead this change in your company, providing all necessary guidance and resources to align all key departments. If the CEO can’t ensure this alignment, is there another C-level role tasked with solving this?

### 12.5 Key Takeaways {#12-dot-5-key-takeaways}

-   A product-led GTM strategy requires a complete alignment of the product, marketing, sales, and customer success teams, along with changes to the team playbooks.
-   The product playbook will use a unified customer profile based on detailed in-product behavior to decide what to build next, and learn how new features and updates are adopted. A new product operations role could evolve — one that supports all of the teams with processes, workflows, and technologies.
-   The marketing playbook will focus on product signups, nurturing prospects to PQLs, and developing thought leadership content based on in-product behavior.
-   The sales playbook will learn from in-product behavior when customers are ready to buy, renew, and/or upgrade, which will allow sales to then prioritize PQLs and optimize their land-and-expand strategies.
-   The customer success playbook lays out how to piece together customer data and build workflows for manual customer outreach. This team will need to improve customer onboarding and training, while working to prevent customer support issues.

There is plenty of material available on SaaS metrics; we will reference a few valuable resources in this section.

#### Measuring Effectiveness with Conversion Rates <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#measuring-effectiveness-with-conversion-rates}

Visitor-to-Signup Rate is the percentage of visitors that visit your page and then sign up. It is calculated by dividing the number of product signups by the number of visitors to a signup page. The visitor-to-signup rate shows how effectively your company convinces visitors to sign up for free trials or a freemium.

Signup-to-PQL Rate is the percentage of prospects that complete profile and in-product engagement requirements to become PQLs. It is calculated by dividing the number of PQLs by the number of signups. The signup-to-PQL rate provides insights into how effectively your company engages prospects in the early stages of reaching initial value.

PQL-to-Customer Rate is the percentage of PQLs that convert to customers. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers by the number of PQLs. The PQL-to-customer rate shows how effectively your company converts PQLs to customers.

Signup-to-Customer Rate is the percentage of signups that become paying customers. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers by the number of signups. The signup-to-customer rate shows how your company, on average, converts signups to customers.

Customer Churn Rate is the percentage of customers lost due to churn (i.e., cancellation or failure to renew). It is calculated by dividing the number of churned customers by the number of customers at the start of the period for which the churn rate is calculated.

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Churn Rate (a.k.a. Gross Revenue Churn) is the percentage of MRR revenue lost from existing customers at the start of the period for which MRR churn is calculated. MRR churn rate is always positive (positive churn rate means the company loses money), because it does not include upsell and cross-sell.

MRR Expansion Rate (aka Net Revenue Retention Rate) is the percentage of MRR that is gained due to upsells and cross-sells to existing customers for the period for which MRR expansion is calculated. It is calculated by dividing the amount of expansion MRR by the starting MRR.

Net MRR Churn (a.k.a. Net Revenue Churn) is the percentage of MRR change based on churned and expansion MRR for the same period. It is calculated by subtracting expansion MRR from churned MRR and dividing that by MRR at the start of the period. Net MRR churn is the percentage of MRR lost from existing customers in a period.
