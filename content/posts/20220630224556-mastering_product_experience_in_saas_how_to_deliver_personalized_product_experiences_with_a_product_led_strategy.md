## Chapter 1: Welcome to the Customer Experience Era <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-1-welcome-to-the-customer-experience-era}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220701_100129screenshot.png" >}}

[a study published in the Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-value-of-customer-experience-quantified) found that customers who had the best experiences with a transaction-based business spent 140 percent more than customers who had the worst experiences.

let’s dig a bit more into the impact of digital transformation across industries.


### 1.1 Digital Transformation is Changing Everything {#1-dot-1-digital-transformation-is-changing-everything}

Between 2000 and 2014, 52 percent of Fortune 500 companies disappeared, either by going bankrupt or through acquisition.


#### Retail Books: Borders vs. Amazon {#retail-books-borders-vs-dot-amazon}


#### Movie Rentals: Blockbuster vs. Netflix {#movie-rentals-blockbuster-vs-dot-netflix}

In 2000, Blockbuster made almost $800 million in late fees ([roughly 16 percent of its revenue](http://archive.boston.com/business/articles/2010/09/23/blockbuster_tries_to_rewrite_script_in_bankruptcy/)).


#### Recruiting: Monster vs. LinkedIn {#recruiting-monster-vs-dot-linkedin}


#### Hospitality: Airbnb vs. Hotels {#hospitality-airbnb-vs-dot-hotels}

Digital transformation reaches all aspects of human society, and will continue to influence software creation and delivery. As [Marc Andreessen]({{< relref "20211211010651-marc_andreessen.md" >}}) famously said, “[Software is eating the world](http://www.aberdeeninvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Why-Software-Is-Eating-The-World-8-20-111.pdf),” meaning every company will become a software company, engaging with its customers through digital channels.


### 1.2 Customer Expectations are Constantly Evolving {#1-dot-2-customer-expectations-are-constantly-evolving}

Bill Price, President of Driva Solutions and author of “Your Customer Rules!,” points out that as an engineer or procurement manager is buying software, he or she is exposed to multiple customer experiences.


### 1.3 The Third Wave of SaaS: The Customer Experience Era {#1-dot-3-the-third-wave-of-saas-the-customer-experience-era}

The early days of digital transformation brought a new subscription-based business model to enterprise software.


#### First wave: from on-premise to the cloud {#first-wave-from-on-premise-to-the-cloud}

Salesforce pioneered and popularized the SaaS model for enterprise software.


#### Second wave: new processes and workflows plus affordability {#second-wave-new-processes-and-workflows-plus-affordability}

SaaS companies in the second wave (the SaaS 2.0 era) brought more features to customers at a lower cost.


#### Third wave: customer experience and personalization {#third-wave-customer-experience-and-personalization}

Customers now research, evaluate, select, and share experiences that feel more like consumer experiences, involving numerous interactions across multiple touchpoints.

McKinsey research (23) shows that, on average, “a B2B customer will regularly use six different interaction channels throughout the decision journey, and almost 65 percent will come away from it frustrated by inconsistent experiences” across these channels.


## Chapter 2: Defining Customer Experience <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-2-defining-customer-experience}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_012552screenshot.png" >}}


### 2.1 What Are Customer Experience, Touchpoints, Interactions, and Engagements? {#2-dot-1-what-are-customer-experience-touchpoints-interactions-and-engagements}

It’s the totality of all touchpoints, interactions, and engagements with a company or brand.

if customer expectations are very high, even a great performance can fall short; and in most companies, marketing and sales set those expectations

[User Experience]({{< relref "20210731181956-user_experience.md" >}}) Customer experience (CX) is a customer’s perception about a company, brand, or product, based on all touchpoints, interactions, and engagements.

It’s inherently a balanced relationship between what each customer expects, and what he or she gets.
This is why customer experience should include a whole universe of touchpoints, interactions, and engagement that a customer has with a company, brand, or product.
question surfaces: what do you mean by touchpoints, interactions, and engagement? “Touchpoint” is sometimes defined as an interaction, and “customer interaction” is often used interchangeably with “customer engagement.”

[Touchpoint]({{< relref "20220702013348-touchpoint.md" >}}) (customer touchpoint) is a single moment when a customer comes in contact with, or is exposed to, a company’s brand, product, employees, or message through any channel or device.

Now let’s say you walk into a store, and notice a Nike shoe. That’s a [Touchpoint]({{< relref "20220702013348-touchpoint.md" >}}) . When you pick up a shoe to feel the texture, or try it on, that’s an interaction. In a sense, interaction is a two-way “communication” that happens between a prospective customer and the company or product.

Customer interaction is a two-way communication between a customer and a company’s brand or product.

Customer [Engagement]({{< relref "20210906161249-activation.md" >}})is a commitment or agreement of a customer to act.


### 2.2 Evaluating a Customer Experience Strategy {#2-dot-2-evaluating-a-customer-experience-strategy}

Your company not only sells products or services, but also delivers customer experience.
companies can’t fully control how customers perceive the experience.
face certain challenges when designing a customer experience strategy.

-   First,what they expect can be based on individual biases, among other things.
-   Second, B2B industry is still quite different. More complex products, longer sales cycles, and multiple stakeholders in buying decisions contribute to the complexity of overseeing
-   Third, customer experience has to be evaluated from end to end
-   Last, organizations see customer experience through the lens of a specific part of the business, such as a department

[Customer Experience Strategy]({{< relref "20210731181956-user_experience.md#customer-experience-strategy" >}}) is an ongoing process of assessing and managing customer experiences across the customer lifecycle.
companies have to design journeys for multiple stakeholders and decision makers.


### 2.3 Why is Customer Experience Critical for SaaS Companies? {#2-dot-3-why-is-customer-experience-critical-for-saas-companies}

The first major reason why customer experience is critical in today’s world is the fact that 30 percent of customers are willing to share bad experiences. Secondly, 19 percent of customers will not trust a company again after just one bad experience[^fn:1]. We believe companies are at risk of going out of business if they can’t differentiate themselves by creating meaningful customer experiences.


#### Customer experience as a competitive advantage {#customer-experience-as-a-competitive-advantage}


#### Customer experience as a growth engine {#customer-experience-as-a-growth-engine}


### 2.4 Why is Personalization Intrinsic to Customer Experience? {#2-dot-4-why-is-personalization-intrinsic-to-customer-experience}

[Personalization]({{< relref "20220316171631-personalization.md" >}}) is a process of tailoring a service or product, message, experience, price, or preferred channel to accommodate a specific customer.


## Chapter 3: Show, Don’t Tell <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-3-show-don-t-tell}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_142541screenshot.png" >}}

we cover six essential steps for evolving to become an experience-centric organization:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_142648screenshot.png" >}}


### 3.1 The Buying Process Outweighs the Sales Process {#3-dot-1-the-buying-process-outweighs-the-sales-process}


### 3.2 Why Traditional Customer Acquisition Falls Short <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#3-dot-2-why-traditional-customer-acquisition-falls-short}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_142836screenshot.png" >}}

Why isn’t this approach very effective?
Imagine that you have to talk to a sales clerk in front of the store and share your e-mail and other contact information just to walk in. Would you consider this a good customer experience?


### 3.3 Getting Personal is Paramount {#3-dot-3-getting-personal-is-paramount}

Allowing prospects to sign up and try a product improves customer experiences, and provides teams with relevant behavioral data that helps them further personalize the experience — and that ultimately yields a loyal customer and higher lifetime value.


### 3.4 Buyers Want to Go It Alone {#3-dot-4-buyers-want-to-go-it-alone}

According to Forrester Research, 59 percent of B2B buyers prefer not to interact with a sales rep, and [74 percent find buying from a website more convenient](https://www.forrester.com/report/Death+Of+A+B2B+Salesman/-/E-RES122288)

> 也并非完全如此，我自己作为客户在调研一些新的产品的时候，要分两种情况，一种是产品本身在网站上的信息已经足够让我理解这是一款怎样的产品，通过产品介绍和一些简单的 demo 我其实可以自己上手这款产品了，对于这种情况，我并不需要 Sales 接入，如果有明确的价格其实就可以自己决定是否需要购买了。
>
> 另外一个是产品本身特别复杂，即便是观看 demo 也不能完全了解产品，或者是产品是在一个完全新的领域，应该如何正确的使用这款产品都需要 Sales 来帮助介绍和理解。


### 3.5 Customer Experience Requires a New Way of Thinking and Acting <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#3-dot-5-customer-experience-requires-a-new-way-of-thinking-and-acting}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_150518screenshot.png" >}}


### 3.6 Embracing a [Bottom-Up Sales]({{< relref "20220702150735-bottom_up_sales.md" >}}) Strategy {#3-dot-6-embracing-a-bottom-up-sales--20220702150735-bottom-up-sales-dot-md--strategy}

Trello, Zoom.us, and Asana drive customer acquisition with a bottom-up sales strategy, thus getting individuals in organizations to use their products first; and if the product is valuable for them, the rest of the organization is more likely to adopt it.


## Chapter 4: Taking an Outside-In Perspective of the Customer Lifecycle <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-4-taking-an-outside-in-perspective-of-the-customer-lifecycle}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_150830screenshot.png" >}}

First, agile methodologies emphasized shorter development cycles to minimize risk and ensure a shorter feedback loop from customers.
Second, agile shifted the focus from the product lifecycle to the customer lifecycle as the primary GTM strategy.


### 4.1 What is a Product Lifecycle? {#4-dot-1-what-is-a-product-lifecycle}

[Product Lifecycle]({{< relref "20211227191240-product_lifecycle.md" >}}) is a framework that helps a company organize its marketing and sales of a product, from introducing it to the market to when sales peak and decline.
Figure 4.1 shows a classic product lifecycle diagram where each stage corresponds to specific sales and marketing strategies, [programs, and campaigns](https://www.coursehero.com/study-guides/boundless-marketing/product-life-cycles/).

For example, [Amazon releases new software every 11.6 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxk8b9rSKOo)! This became possible thanks to a new set of technologies called “[continuous deployment](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-personalized-user-experience-intrinsic-product-nick-bonfiglio/)”.


#### What Is the Customer Lifecycle? {#what-is-the-customer-lifecycle}

[Customer Lifecycle]({{< relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md" >}}) is a framework that describes the process a customer goes through when considering, buying, using, and advocating use of a product or service.

a customer lifecycle is a continuous process of retaining, expanding, and creating loyal customers

We included a y-axis to show whether a prospective customer has access to, and interacts with, the product at a particular stage.
The x-axis shows the time it takes for a prospect to progress.

In addition to taking into consideration metrics like customer satisfaction and [Net Promoter Score]({{< relref "20220702151849-net_promoter_score.md" >}})(NPS), this customer lifecycle views customers as loyal after they renew their subscription for the first time.


### 4.2 The Four Stages of the SaaS Customer Lifecycle {#4-dot-2-the-four-stages-of-the-saas-customer-lifecycle}

let’s break down the four critical stages of a SaaS customer lifecycle: acquisition, adoption, retention, and expansion ([modified based the following Customer Lifecycle framework](https://www.mykpono.com/how-to-track-customer-acquisitions/)):


#### Acquisition stage {#acquisition-stage}

The business goal is to influence prospects to try a product or service.

-   **Customer goal**: Quickly assess pain-product fit and obvious benefits
-   **Question**: Does this product address my immediate needs?
-   **Customer action**: Signup/Trial

Customer experience focus:

-   What customer segments should we engage, and what’s the value of features we should be promoting?
-   How can we reduce friction for buyers and influence them to try our solution?


#### Adoption stage {#adoption-stage}

The business goal is to onboard prospects and showcase relevant value of the product.

-   **Customer goal**: Learn how to use the product, evaluate it, and make a buying decision
-   **Question**: Is this product easy to use? Does it address my needs? Do I want to buy it?
-   **Customer action**: Onboarding/Initial value delivered/Convert to customer

Customer experience focus:

-   How can we make customer experience a core value that our solution delivers?
-   How can we accelerate and increase the trial-to-customer conversion rate
-   How can we nurture and re-engage customers with the product based on unique customer behaviors?


#### Retention stage {#retention-stage}

The business goal is to ensure that customers receive expected value from the product regularly, and possess knowledge about newly released product features and capabilities.

-   **Customer goal**: Receive value and benefit from the product
-   **Question**: Do I still value and want to actively use this product? Is this product essential to achieving my personal and/or professional goals?
-   **Customer action**: Daily Active User (DAU)/Monthly Active User (MAU)

Customer experience focus:

-   How can we ensure customers continuously receive value from using the product?
-   How does customer behavior in the product help to prevent churn and predict CLV?


#### Expansion stage <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#expansion-stage}

The business goal is to influence customers to renew, increase product usage, purchase an upsell or cross-sell, and advocate use of the product.

-   **Customer goal**: Explore how to be more empowered and successful
-   **Question**: Will I become more effective with increased product usage or new features?
-   **Customer action**: Renewal/Upsell/Cross-sell/Advocate

Customer experience focus:

-   How can we deliver features and experiences that are more valuable to customers, and influence them to buy more or upgrade their subscription
-   How can we enable our customers to become public advocates?

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_154156screenshot.png" >}}

Table 4.1 summarizes customer and business goals for each stage of the lifecycle. When companies use a customer lifecycle framework, they can reevaluate their own processes to ensure that organizational goals are aligned with customer needs and expectations. From the customer lifecycle, we can infer the following:

-   Every stage in the customer lifecycle corresponds to a specific need that must be addressed before a customer moves to the next stage, resulting in deeper engagement with a product and the company.
-   Three out of four stages (adoption, retention, and expansion) occur while the customer uses the product. As a result, in-product behaviors and engagement and behavioral data should influence most of the customer journey throughout the lifecycle.
-   The new customer acquisition process is closing the gap between the time the prospect and company engage in conversation, and the time the prospect tries the product.
-   Retention and expansion stages in a customer lifecycle are a continuous process of delivering value to the customer. See the highlighted “loyalty loop” in the customer lifecycle diagram (Figure 4.2).
-   The earlier product lifecycle approach encouraged companies to focus on marketing and sales strategies based on where the product was in the cycle. Customer lifecycle puts customers at the center, and helps companies focus on how to market and sell software products in response to customer needs and preferences.


## Chapter 5: Understanding the Whole Customer Journey <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-5-understanding-the-whole-customer-journey}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_154304screenshot.png" >}}

The [Customer Journey]({{< relref "20211113002725-user_journey_map.md" >}}) is a series of all touchpoints a customer has with a company, brand, or product to reach a certain milestone.
While individual customer journeys can vary greatly from one customer to another, SaaS companies need to understand the overall pattern.

Improving the [Customer Experience]({{< relref "20210731181956-user_experience.md" >}}) starts with the company understanding its [Customer Lifecycle]({{< relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md" >}}). The next step is evaluating current journeys, and designing new optimal ones that lead customers to desired outcomes and milestones.

To summarize, the process of transitioning to a customer-experience company follows these steps:

-   [Customer Lifecycle]({{< relref "20210729233505-customer_lifetime.md" >}})
    What is the customer lifecycle for our most profitable customers? How can we make this lifecycle as rewarding and frictionless as possible?
-   [Customer Journey]({{< relref "20211113002725-user_journey_map.md" >}})
    What are the most important customer journeys? What milestones advance the customer along the lifecycle?
-   [Touchpoint]({{< relref "20220702013348-touchpoint.md" >}}), interactions, and [Engagement]({{< relref "20210906161249-activation.md" >}}).
    What are the most optimal touchpoints and interaction for each customer journey? Can some be eliminated or simplified?


### 5.1 Tracking Customer Journeys <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#5-dot-1-tracking-customer-journeys}

[In-Product Customer Journey]({{< relref "20220702155637-in_product_user_journey.md" >}}) is a sequence of all touchpoints that a customer has inside the product.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_155844screenshot.png" >}}

We send a reminder e-mail to him; John opens it, but doesn’t return to the product. Two days later, we send another reminder to entice John to come back, create a product, and install JS code. This time, John returns to the app and creates a new product that generates a unique code. Since we are not collecting any data for John’s product, we know he didn’t install JS code, so we send a reminder e-mail. The next day, Aptrinsic starts collecting analytics data for John’s product, which means he installed the JS code. The journey to realize initial value is complete. Reaching this milestone allows John to track and analyze his product inside of Aptrinsic. It also allows us to track his product usage and optimize his engagement.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_160033screenshot.png" >}}

Danielle starts with the same touchpoint as John, and signs up for a free trial; but unlike John, Danielle engages with the product right away using essential product features that showcase the initial product value to first-time users. During the initial free trial signup, Danielle completes onboarding and creates a new product that generates a unique JS code. She then logs in to the product the next day and receives an in-product notification to install the JS code and start collecting product analytics data.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_172657screenshot.png" >}}

Figure 5.3 shows both journeys in the context of the customer lifecycle.
The velocity with which a prospect moves through the lifecycle to reach the next stage is a very important factor to consider and prioritize. Shorter time to value will likely correlate with higher probability to close and to become a highly satisfied DAU.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220702_172810screenshot.png" >}}

If we plotted many customer journeys into the customer lifecycle, we could identify the optimal path to initial value.

Every touchpoint and interaction along the journey is an opportunity for the company to influence the prospective customer’s impression and create a deeper relationship between the company and prospective customer. This is what could be referred to as a Moment of Truth.

A [Moment of Truth]({{< relref "20220702173833-moment_of_truth.md" >}})(MOT), in marketing, is the moment when a customer/user interacts with a brand, product, or service in a way that serves to form or change an impression about that brand, product, or service.


### 5.2 Mind the Value Gap! {#5-dot-2-mind-the-value-gap}

This is what we call a [Value Gap]({{< relref "20220702174017-value_gap.md" >}}). It is a difference between expected and delivered (or perceived) value.
A [Value Gap]({{< relref "20220702174017-value_gap.md" >}}) is the discrepancy between what a customer expects from the product and the value received or perceived.

A Value Gap can happen for many reasons, but here are some big ones:

-   Product fails to provide adequate value
-   Customer is the wrong fit for the product
-   Customer doesn’t understand a product’s capabilities or how to use it
-   Customer experiences something jarring or painful (i.e., confusion, dissatisfaction, competitive incentive, etc.) that changes their perception while using the product

In the example of John and Danielle’s journeys, we defined initial value as a milestone when the prospect installs tracking code and starts collecting product analytics data.

[Initial Value]({{< relref "20220702175445-initial_value.md" >}}) is when a customer first experiences product value.

let’s see how different companies define [Initial Value]({{< relref "20220702175445-initial_value.md" >}}):

-   For Asana, initial value can mean creating a new project, with tasks successfully assigned to a team member.
-   For Zoom.us, it can mean signing up, organizing, and holding the first video conference.
-   For Expensify, it could be creating the first expense report that is approved for payment.
-   For Aptrinsic, initial value is delivered when a customer signs up, installs our tracking JS, and starts receiving product usage data from their customers.


### 5.3 What are Value or Golden Features? {#5-dot-3-what-are-value-or-golden-features}

[Value Features]({{< relref "20220702180301-value_features.md" >}}) — sometimes known as “golden features” — are a set of product features that a prospect or customer must use to realize value and advance to the next stage of the customer lifecycle. During customer acquisition and adoption, value features guide prospects through a core use case, which is a common customer journey that users experience on a regular basis.


### 5.4 Key Takeaways {#5-dot-4-key-takeaways}

-   An in-product customer journey is a set of all prospect/customer touchpoints inside the product.
-   Giving prospective customers access to the product early in the acquisition stage reduces a marketing team’s reliance on engagements outside the product and increases the importance and impact of product engagements.
-   While they’re in the product, prospects and customers are more likely to experience a MoT, when they form or change an impression about the brand, product, or service.
-   A Value Gap occurs when there’s a discrepancy between what the customer expects from the product and the value he or she actually receives or perceives. The company then must re-engage the customer right away to close the gap.
-   An Engagement Loop uses product usage data to influence prospects and customers to re-engage.
-   A Loyalty Loop delivers substantial value and experience to keep customers using the product and adopting new features, leading eventually to renewal.
-   The initial value unit is an engagement, or set of engagements, that advances the customer through a core use case. Valued (golden) features are ones a prospect or customer must use to realize initial value.


## Chapter 6: From Silos to a Cross-functional Focus on Customer Experience <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-6-from-silos-to-a-cross-functional-focus-on-customer-experience}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_161413screenshot.png" >}}

Customer lifecycle bubbles up critical questions, like:

-   Why do customers and organizations buy what they buy?
-   How do they buy?


### 6.1 The Traditional Customer Handoff is Ineffective {#6-dot-1-the-traditional-customer-handoff-is-ineffective}

Figure 6.1 shows that each team is responsible for only part of the customer lifecycle. A prospective customer is passed from one department to another.
Further, each department has goals and incentives that are aligned only with the part of the customer lifecycle for which they are responsible. The marketing team is incentivized based on leads; sales is based on demos and closed deals; customer success on churn rate and renewals.
for example, a customer receives multiple e-mails — from marketing telling them about an upcoming webinar, from the customer success team notifying them about their upcoming renewal, and from the product team informing them about a new feature release.
On top of that, each department is likely to use its own technology to send customer communications.

In his book [The Sales Acceleration Formula]({{< relref "20210804233445-the_sales_acceleration_formula_using_data_technology_and_inbound_selling_to_go_from_0_to_100_million.md" >}}), Mark Roberge explains how Hubspot changed sales compensation plans to address a growing customer churn rate1. This is the first and critical step of sales and customer success teams: sharing responsibility for CLV and churn rate.


### 6.2 Why Aren’t Product Teams More Involved in the Customer Acquisition Process? <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#6-dot-2-why-aren-t-product-teams-more-involved-in-the-customer-acquisition-process}

Undoubtedly, the marketing, sales, customer success, and product teams should all be responsible for the customer experience. It is not easy to do.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_164802screenshot.png" >}}


### 6.3 Unified Customer Profile Data is Essential to Stellar Customer Experiences {#6-dot-3-unified-customer-profile-data-is-essential-to-stellar-customer-experiences}

To be successful at providing a personalized customer experience, your organization needs a single system of record for all customer profile, company, and behavioral data.
Wondering if your organization is suffering because of these issues? Ask yourself these questions:

-   How often do your top 20 percent of customers, based on annual contract, log in to your product?
-   What are the top in-product journeys for these customers, from adoption to expansion?
-   What are the top three features that these customers use?
-   How quickly can you design messages to engage a customer or showcase your new features?
-   What features cause customers to stop using the product?
-   Where in the top three customer journeys are your prospects and clients getting stuck?

Unified customer data should include these details:

-   Profile data: name, title, contact information
-   Company data (a.k.a. firmographics): size, subscription level, support tickets for all organizations and regions
-   Behavioral data: daily/monthly active users, number of logins over a period of time, number of completed core use cases, number of features interacted with


### 6.4 From Department Goals to Customer-Centric Goals <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#6-dot-4-from-department-goals-to-customer-centric-goals}

The first step is to tie [Customer Experience Metric]({{< relref "20210731181956-user_experience.md#customer-experience-metric" >}})s to the core objectives and goals of each department. [LTV]({{< relref "20210731022109-customer_lifetime_value.md" >}}) is one of the best metrics to measure and evaluate the long-term health of customer relationships. Net Promoter Score ([NPS]({{< relref "20220702151849-net_promoter_score.md" >}})) is another metric that measures customer satisfaction and how customers value the experience with your product and company.
As a guide,[look at how Hubspot changed its sales compensation plan to reflect CLV](https://thinkgrowth.org/how-sales-comp-plans-impact-customer-churn-23a15ecad5ef).

Table 6.1 summarizes the metrics each department traditionally tracks throughout the customer acquisition process.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_170053screenshot.png" >}}

In Table 6.2, below, we’ve added the product team to show how its goals, activities, and metrics fit with the whole customer acquisition process.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_170219screenshot.png" >}}

How does this all relate to a personalized customer experience? It’s about creating alignment and insight to meet and exceed customer expectations.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_170409screenshot.png" >}}


### 6.5 Key Takeaways {#6-dot-5-key-takeaways}

-   Customer lifecycle enables companies to focus on the buying process from the customer’s point of view rather than from the sales process standpoint.
-   Siloed departments make it difficult to design seamless customer experiences.
-   Product teams need to be more active in the customer acquisition process and overall customer lifecycle.
-   Aggregating customer data across many technologies, managed by different departments, is challenging. Production data and in-product customer behavioral data are essential to creating a unified customer profile view.
-   Insufficient customer data is only part of the problem. Companies need tools to create personalized engagement based on timely access to customer data collected across multiple channels.


## Chapter 7: From a Traditional Go-To-Market to a Product-led Go-To-Market Strategy <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#chapter-7-from-a-traditional-go-to-market-to-a-product-led-go-to-market-strategy}

Here is the definition of a traditional GTM strategy:
[Go-to-Market Strategy]({{< relref "20210812231906-go_to_market.md#go-to-market-strategy" >}}) is an action plan that describes repeatable and scalable processes for how a company acquires, retains, and grows customers.

a [GTM Strategy]({{< relref "20210812231906-go_to_market.md#go-to-market-strategy" >}}) must be repeatable and scalable.

-   Repeatable means that the organization can expect very similar results when executing against a particular GTM playbook.
-   Scalable means the company can hire and train new employees using the GTM playbook, and see proportional revenue growth in acquiring customers.

but in the last two decades, digital transformation drove an explosion of new channels for organizations to reach prospective customers.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_171445screenshot.png" >}}

This new strategy is referred to as a product-led GTM strategy.
[Product-Led Go-to-Market]({{< relref "20220703171641-product_led_go_to_market.md" >}}) strategy is an action plan that describes repeatable and scalable processes for how a company acquires, retains, and grows customers, driven by in-product customer behavior, feedback, product usage, and analytics.

In fact, OpenView, a venture capital firm, says your [product is a key part of your marketing](https://openviewpartners.com/blog/product-led-growth-marketing-strategies/#.WdPoi4plAUG).

### 7.1 Are Marketing-Qualified Leads (MQLs) Dead? {#7-dot-1-are-marketing-qualified-leads--mqls--dead}

Gating content as a way to generate leads has become increasingly less effective.

the average [Conversion Rate]({{< relref "20220305090504-conversion.md#conversion-rate" >}}) from visitor to lead is around 5 to 15 percent.
the conversion rate from lead to a won deal is anywhere from 1 to 10 percent.

What about [Lead Nurturing]({{< relref "20220703172740-lead_nurturing.md" >}}) and [Lead Scoring]({{< relref "20220703172757-lead_scoring.md" >}})?
Lead nurturing based only on contact information (i.e., demographic data) and marketing activities (e.g., opened e-mail, visited web page) can’t be very effective.
As a result, sales teams spend time working and further qualifying these leads as SQLs. This not only makes things inefficient, it increases the CAC.

If you want to explore this further, read why Tom Wentworth, CMO of RapidMiner, is [killing MQLs](https://tomwentworth.com/2016/05/17/why-im-killing-the-marketing-qualified-lead-95c90874bc6f/).

Some of the fastest-growing companies in recent years do not put any lead generation forms on their websites, and instead invite prospects to try their products. This list includes Zoom.us, Asana, inVision, and Slack — and it’s growing.

A [Content Strategy]({{< relref "20220703173433-content_strategy.md" >}})
has become one of the most efficient ways for companies to engage with prospects, by educating target audiences (prospects and customers) on industry trends, new strategies, and tactics.


### 7.2 What Are Product-Qualified Leads (PQLs)? {#7-dot-2-what-are-product-qualified-leads--pqls}

[PQL]({{< relref "20210924095503-product_qualified_lead.md" >}}) concept is in an article by Tomasz Tunguz from early 2013, “[The Product-Qualified Lead (PQL)](https://tomtunguz.com/the-new-sales-hotness-the-product-qualified-lead-pql/).”
the PQL only makes sense as part of a larger, product-led GTM strategy.

We believe PQLs are a better way for cross-functional teams to create sales-ready accounts and more active customers.

[Product-Qualified Lead]({{< relref "20210924095503-product_qualified_lead.md" >}}) (PQL) is a prospect that signed up and demonstrated buying intent based on product interest, usage, and behavioral data.

Instead of driving prospects to lead forms, a product-led GTM strategy drives prospects to sign up for a product or free trial.
A product-led GTM strategy streamlines the customer acquisition process for SaaS organizations by focusing on one entry point for prospects.
They also afford the company’s teams the opportunity to analyze [how prospects interact with the product in their natural environment](https://review.firstround.com/amazons-friction-killing-tactics-to-make-products-more-seamless).

In the article “Why Product-Qualified Leads are the Answer to a Failing Freemium Model”, Christopher ODonnell explains why PQLs are critical for companies with a freemium business model.

### 7.3 The Traditional Approach to Customer Acquisition Process {#7-dot-3-the-traditional-approach-to-customer-acquisition-process}

What is important to highlight is that a large portion of the traditional customer acquisition process happens outside of the product.

[Dropbox]({{< relref "20211230140136-dropbox.md" >}}) is an example of a company that drives prospects directly into the product and nurtures them until they are ready to buy.

As shown, product-led GTM strategies provide several benefits.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/_20220703_180633screenshot.png" >}}

Simply put, your product should be at the center of your GTM strategy — your action plan for how your company acquires, retains, and grows customers.
