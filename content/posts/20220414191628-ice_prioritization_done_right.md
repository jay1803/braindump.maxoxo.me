## ICE Prioritization Done Right {#ice-prioritization-done-right}


### What is ICE? {#what-is-ice}

With ICE we assign each idea three values:

-   Impact – how much does this idea stand to improve the key metric we want to
    grow. I explain below what this key metric is.
-   Confidence – how sure are we that we will have this impact? Another way to put
    this— how strong is the evidence in support of our impact assessment.
-   Ease – how easy is it going to be to build and launch this idea in full.
    Usually this is the opposite of person/weeks.
