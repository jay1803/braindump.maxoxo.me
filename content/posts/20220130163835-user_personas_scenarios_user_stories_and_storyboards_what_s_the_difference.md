## User Personas, Scenarios, User Stories And Storyboards: What’s the Difference? {#user-personas-scenarios-user-stories-and-storyboards-what-s-the-difference}


### 1 — User Personas {#1-user-personas}

A user [Persona]({{<relref "20210822033315-persona.md#" >}}) is an archetype or character that represents a potential user of
your website or app. In user centered-design, personas help the design team to
target their designs around users.

### 2 — User stories {#2-user-stories}

A [User Story]({{<relref "20220130164208-user_story.md#" >}}) is a short statement or abstract that identifies the user and their
need/goal. It determines who the user is, what they need and why they need it.
There is usually one user story per user [Persona]({{<relref "20210822033315-persona.md#" >}}).

For example: “As a UX Manager, John oversees all the design projects, including
assets creation and prototyping efforts, at the design consultancy where he
works. He needs easy access to a design tool that allows him to centralize UI
libraries so that multiple designers to work simultaneously on a prototype.”

### 3 — Scenarios {#3-scenarios}

A [Scenario]({{<relref "20220130132918-scenario.md#" >}}) is a situation that captures how users perform tasks on your site or
app. Scenarios describe the user’s motivations for being onsite (their task or
goal) and/or a question they need answered, and suggest possible ways to
accomplish these objectives. It is essentially a development of the [User Story]({{<relref "20220130164208-user_story.md#" >}}),
and can relate to multiple target users. However, scenarios can also be broken
down into [Use Case]({{<relref "20220130133218-use_case.md#" >}}) that describe the flow of tasks that any one user takes in a
given functionality or path.

For example, a scenario could outline how John uses a mobile app to buy a ticket
to a design workshop whilst on his way to work.

### 4 — Storyboards {#4-storyboards}

A [Storyboard]({{<relref "20220130170103-storyboard.md#" >}}) is a visual representation of how the user would react with your
site or app.
